<div><head><title>TWENTIETH ANNUAL EXHIBITION OF THE ACADEMY
 OF NATIONAL DESIGN.</title></head>
<div><p>HE Artists of New York,<lb/>
make their appeal to the<lb/>
public but once a year;<lb/>
eleven months they labor<lb/>
in their retired studios—<lb/>
unknown but to a select<lb/>
few, seeking, like miners<lb/>
in the dark, after the<lb/>
gems which a thoughtless<lb/>
world will regard with<lb/>
as much indifference as<lb/>
though they were soap<lb/>
bubbles which had been<lb/>
created by a puff, and like a puff could be meetly rewarded<lb/>
Among the innumerable excitements of our busy life, the open-<lb/>
ing of the Academy seems but a trivial matter, yet to many<lb/>
an ambitious spirit it is the one great event of the year. That<lb/>
modest little canvass, bearing upon its surface a remote like-<lb/>
ness of a kitten, a decayed tree, or a red-nosed toper, and<lb/>
hung, or rather stuck in a pokerish corner on a level with<lb/>
one’s boots, as though spectators carried their eyes in their<lb/>
ankles, insignificant as it may appear to you or me, is an ob-<lb/>
ject of immense importance to somebody; the corner stone<lb/>
of a young artist’s reputation, the point d'appui of his for-<lb/>
tunes and happiness; and you may be sure that the obscure<lb/>
position in which the merciless "hangers" have placed his<lb/>
chef d'œuvre has caused him a cruel palpitation of the heart,<lb/>
and not unlikely a flood of tears, and he has promised him-<lb/>
self that when he gets to be a “ hanger" he will be sure and<lb/>
give all young artists a place on the line. Happy period of<lb/>
hopes and disappointments, when there is something to look<lb/>
forward to! It is better to be a poor artist with something<lb/>
to gain, than a Rafaelle with powers fully developed an no-<lb/>
thing more to hope for.<lb/>
The first glance at the exhibition, impressed us with an<lb/>
idea of its superiority over the exhibition of the last year, and<lb/>
a more deliberate survey of the pictures has confirmed the<lb/>
impression. There is a smaller number of works than the<lb/>
exhibition of last year contained, and consequently there are<lb/>
fewer bad pictures; we understand that there were some<lb/>
paintings rejected, and every sincere friend of Art will regret<lb/>
that the committee bad not rejected “ some more." It is no<lb/>
disgrace to an artist to paint a poor picture, but it is a dis-<lb/>
grace to an institution like the National Academy, which<lb/>
assumes the responsible duty of fostering and encouraging<lb/>
Art, to exhibit pictures to the public, which have no artis-<lb/>
tic merit of any kind. It is a mistaken kindness to an<lb/>
artist to exhibit one of his works that will bring him into<lb/>
contempt; it will be better that he remain unknown,<lb/>
than known unfavorably ; his crude works, which may appear<lb/>
respectably in his own room, when hung by the side of a<lb/>
finished performance will appear very bad. The hanging<lb/>
committee have an extremely delicate duty, and it is easy<lb/>
to understand the difficulty of rejecting the work of a per-<lb/>
sonal friend or of an associate, but their duty to the cause of<lb/>
Art, and even to the individual himself, should outweigh<lb/>
every other consideration, and no amiable feelings should be<lb/>
allowed to avert the decisions of an honest judgment. Every<lb/>
visiter to the exhibition will feel that the committee of ar-<lb/>
rangement have done themselves—the cause of Art, and one<lb/>
of their own members, a grievous wrong, by the admission<lb/>
of the landscape numbered 28 on the catalogue. We do not<lb/>
believe that any member of the Academy, excepting the one<lb/>
who painted it, will say that this picture is worthy of a place<lb/>
in the exhibition, and every body will feel that it will do the<lb/>
artist whose name it bears a positive harm; yet it is given a<lb/>
post of honor, and two of the very best paintings in the<lb/>
exhibition are hung so high that their real merits cannot<lb/>
be discovered. There are other paintings in the exhibition<lb/>
which should have been excluded, but none so obtrusive as<lb/>
this, or by artists who write N. A. at the end of their names.<lb/>
We have heard a very good reason given for hanging this<lb/>
picture.—The artist committed murder, and therefore was<lb/>
hung; to which we agree, but then he should have been<lb/>
hung out of sight: the law of the state says that no criminal<lb/>
shall be hung in public.<lb/>
The exhibition consists of 369 works of Art, contributed<lb/>
by 145 artists, of whom four are foreigners. There are 152<lb/>
portraits, about thirty miniatures, ninety-seven landscapes,<lb/>
fifteen historical compositions, ten or twelve water-color<lb/>
drawings, five pen and ink sketches, two pieces of sculp-<lb/>
ture, one architectural design, and five foreign engravings,<lb/>
which we do not see the propriety of hanging in an exhibi-<lb/>
tion of original pictures.<lb/>
We are very happy to see that the best portraits in the<lb/>
exhibition are contributed by young artists, hitherto unknown,<lb/>
who are neither academicians nor associates, for it is to our<lb/>
young artists that we must look for honorable distinction in<lb/>
the world of Art; and though in landscape the meed of excel-<lb/>
lence must still be awarded to Cole and Durand, and in works<lb/>
of humor, to Mount and Edmonds, there are others, particu-<lb/>
larly in landscape, who are found treading upon their heels,<lb/>
and who will very soon be dividing honors with them. We<lb/>
begin our remarks at the beginning of the catalogue, for the<lb/>
sake of convenience.<lb/>
No. 1. Death of Abel—C. Mayr, A. There are many<lb/>
good points in this picture, although the general effect of it<lb/>
is unpleasant. The subject is both hackneyed and impres-<lb/>
sive and it would be impossible to handle it without repeat-<lb/>
ing somebody’s ideas. The first murder is a solemn theme,<lb/>
and it should be so handled as to leave no trifling impressions<lb/>
on the mind of the spectator, but to do so requires talents<lb/>
which Mr. Mayr evidently lacks. It is truly a melancholy<lb/>
sight to see so much ability, and so much time and good ma-<lb/>
terials, employed all to no purpose. What perfect works<lb/>
should we not see if every man could know what he was<lb/>
258<pb n="258" facs="../images/test.jpg"/><lb/>
THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.<lb/>
best calculated to perform! The merest tyro could tell Mr.<lb/>
Mayr that the head of his Adam is a good deal too small,<lb/>
that Eve is a good deal too young, that Abel lies as flat upon<lb/>
the ground as a board, and that the pointer, though very<lb/>
well painted, detracts from the solemnity of the subject. Full<lb/>
sized naked figures do not show to good advantage in a room<lb/>
as small as that of the National Academy.<lb/>
No. 6. Portrait of Calvin Gitteau.—S. Thayer, Syracuse.<lb/>
As the work of a young artist, this portrait possesses conside-<lb/>
rable merit. Though by no means a very agreeable picture,<lb/>
it is truthful and modest, and very evidently a good likeness<lb/>
of the original.<lb/>
No. 7. Portrait of a Lady—by A. H. Wenzler. We re-<lb/>
gard this picture as the best portrait in the exhibition. There<lb/>
is a leaden tone which pervades it that is far from pleasant(<lb/>
but taken altogether as to drawing, color, and expression, we<lb/>
have seen nothing there that can be placed beside it. This,<lb/>
and the other portraits by the same hand in the exhibition,<lb/>
must give the artist a high position in his profession.<lb/>
No. 8. Red Jacket's Descendants—W. J. Wilgus, Buffalo.<lb/>
The portraits of an Indian woman and her child, are well co-<lb/>
lored, and well drawn, but it is not easy to judge of an artist's<lb/>
ability, in portraiture, from such subjects as this. The only<lb/>
portraits that we have seen by Mr. Wilgus were of Indians;<lb/>
he has an “ H ” at the end of his name, and we believe he<lb/>
enjoys a high reputation at the west as a portrait painter.<lb/>
No. 10. Italy in the Olden time—T. Rossiter, A. This<lb/>
picture is well called after the olden time, for it resembles<lb/>
nothing that the moderns have ever seen. If paintings like<lb/>
this, are the legitimate fruits of a residence in Italy, they<lb/>
should be a caution to our young artists who are longing to<lb/>
go abroad, to remain at home, and be content with Nature.<lb/>
No. 11. Portrait—by H. Peters Gray, N. A. As a color-<lb/>
ist, Mr. Gray undoubtedly stands at the head of the contri-<lb/>
butors to the present exhibition, but his portraits lack other<lb/>
qualities which are more essential in a picture than color;<lb/>
he has taste and fancy in a high degree, but the chief essen-<lb/>
tial of a portrait, correct drawing, is often wanting in his<lb/>
performances. This portrait bears sufficient resemblance to<lb/>
the original to enable his acquaintances to see for whom it<lb/>
is intended, but the head is exceedingly ill drawn, or the<lb/>
position in which he stands is a very bad one.<lb/>
No. 12. Portrait of a Gentleman—W. Swain, A. This is<lb/>
the portrait of Mr. Casilear, an artist of fine abilities, who<lb/>
seems to have a strange reluctance to show his performances<lb/>
to the public. Mr. Swain has succeeded belter in this pic-<lb/>
ture than in any other that we have seen from his easel.—<lb/>
No. 43, A Portrait of Dr. Milnor, by the same artist, is a<lb/>
good likeness, but it is not equal in artistic merit to this of<lb/>
Mr. Casilear.<lb/>
No. 3. The Discovery—by L. P. Clover, A. A small cabi-<lb/>
net painting, representing a lady in a library, reading a let-<lb/>
ter ; a cavalier is looking over her shoulder, who probably<lb/>
discovers something, which gives a title to the picture.<lb/>
Through the open door is seen a life size copy of a group,<lb/>
from the Antique, Cupid and Psyche. Last year the hanging<lb/>
committee rejected a painting by an academician for contain-<lb/>
ing the same figures, infinitely better painted. There is a<lb/>
globe in one comer of the picture, which is well done; it is<lb/>
the only point in the composition upon which we can bestow<lb/>
much commendation. We must confess to a hearty dislike<lb/>
of these masquerade subjects, they are out of place every<lb/>
where excepting in a lady's magazine, and even there they<lb/>
would be out of place if we did not expect to see them as a<lb/>
matter of course. It is impossible that they should embody<lb/>
an idea that will prove either profitable or pleasing to any<lb/>
body, and we cannot but wonder that an artist should throw<lb/>
away his time in producing such inanities, while the world<lb/>
is full of sober realities, whose shadows even appeal forcibly<lb/>
to the heart. Some of Mr. Clover’s earlier sketches seemed<lb/>
to indicate a love of nature which he must have entirely<lb/>
lost. The “Discovery” is a bad picture of a very bad<lb/>
school.<lb/>
No. 13. Portrait of C. H. Marshall—by C. C. Ingham. N.<lb/>
A. Mr. Ingham is probably one of the best painters of silks<lb/>
and velvets in the world ; and if ladies had porcelain necks<lb/>
and coral lips, he would be equally as good a painter of de-<lb/>
licate women; but flesh is a substance that he has never<lb/>
looked at with a view of giving a resemblance to it on his<lb/>
canvas. The subject of this portrait is one of the bluffest<lb/>
looking men in New York, but we should never suspect it<lb/>
from the picture before us. It is carefully and elaborately<lb/>
painted, but still leaves an impression on the mind of a want<lb/>
of finish. A picture may be elaborated to the last extreme,<lb/>
and still appear unfinished—because there will be something<lb/>
wanted. Mr. Ingham’s portraits are admirably adapted to<lb/>
the tastes of a certain class, fortunately a large one, who<lb/>
have the means, and are generally willing to pay liberally<lb/>
for their gratification. While there is a passion for fine fur-<lb/>
niture and fine dresses, he will never lack for sitters; and it<lb/>
is well that there are all kinds of artists, that no tastes may<lb/>
be left ungratified. His portraits will be invaluable a centu-<lb/>
ry or two hence to the student in costumery.<lb/></p></div>
<div><head><title>PUBLIC DISASTERS.</title></head></div><div><ab>
The public press, and the public voice during the last fort-<lb/>
night, have been mainly occupied in discussing the particu-<lb/>
lars of the two great disasters which happened so close toge-<lb/>
ther :—the wreck of the Swallow, and the fire at Pittsburgh.<lb/>
The rumors of a Mexican War were flying about all the<lb/>
while; but though the truth of such rumors would prove<lb/>
the greatest disaster that the country has experienced in<lb/>
thirty years, yet they had no power to divert people from the<lb/>
discussion of a calamity of actual occurrence. Every wonder<lb/>
must live its nine days, and it is a subject of regret that some<lb/>
wonders do not live much longer.<lb/>
There seems to be a general disposition in the public mind<lb/>
to fix the blame of a disaster like that of the Swallow upon<lb/>
some particular individual, and we perceive that the Grand<lb/>
Jury have presented the pilot of that unfortunate boat for<lb/>
manslaughter. But we do not believe that any body enter-<lb/>
tains a serious thought that such a charge can be sustained.<lb/>
It is very possible, in this case of the Swallow, that nobody<lb/>
is to blame but the community at large. If the boat had<lb/>
been properly constructed, not a life would have been lost.<lb/>
But it is the fashion to build steam-boats like birch canoes to<lb/>
satisfy the public craving for rapid travelling, and it must be<lb/>
evideut that a boat one-sixteenth of a mile in length and<lb/>
only thirty feet in breadth, would break in two whenever one<lb/>
end of her should be suspended out of the water. It is true<lb/>
that the chances of such a thing happening on the Hudson<lb/>
river are very few, but those few should have been guarded<lb/>
against. The boats on the river should either have been dif-<lb/>
ferently constructed, or the rock upon which the Swallow<lb/>
struck should have had a beacon placed upon it; and if there<lb/>
are any other places of similar danger in the river, they<lb/>
should have beacons placed upon them without delay.—<lb/>
There may have been very gross carelessness on the part of<lb/>
the pilot of the Swallow, but there will always be careless-<lb/>
ness on the part of other pilots; it is quite impossible to<lb/>
guard against it wholly, and the safer way will be to put it<lb/>
THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.<lb/>
259<pb n="259"/><lb/>
out of the power of carelessness or inefficiency to destroy life<lb/>
and property, by erecting all suitable safeguards before we<lb/>
expose ourselves to danger. The public demand swift ve-<lb/>
hicles when they travel: they must, therefore, be content to<lb/>
pocket such accidents as are consequent upon their rapid<lb/>
manner of travelling. If one of the old-fashioned slow-going<lb/>
boats had been in the place of the Swallow, she would have<lb/>
lain there very comfortably without straining a limb or wet-<lb/>
ting a passenger. We do not condemn rapid travelling, but<lb/>
we condemn the disposition of people not to rest content with<lb/>
the inevitable consequences of their own system.<lb/>
The great fire in Pittsburgh by which millions of property<lb/>
have been destroyed, was owing entirely to a miserable idea<lb/>
of economy, which led the people of that city to construct<lb/>
their houses in such a manner as to invite a general confla-<lb/>
gration. A very little extra expense in the construction of<lb/>
their houses, would have saved them from the terrible cala-<lb/>
mity which has nearly overwhelmed them. We marvel at<lb/>
people who build cities in the neighborhood of a volcano,<lb/>
which may at any moment bury them under a shower of<lb/>
lava; yet we build our cities of the most inflammable mate-<lb/>
rials, neglect to provide the proper means for extinguish-<lb/>
ing a conflagration, and when destruction is upon us stand<lb/>
aghast for a moment, and then go rapidly to work recon-<lb/>
structing our houses of the same perishable materials, and<lb/>
filling them with our most costly goods. A few thousand<lb/>
dollars would have saved New York in 1835 from the disas-<lb/>
trous fire from which she has not yet recovered. Such ano-<lb/>
ther cannot probably ever occur in this city again; we build<lb/>
our houses of better materials and in a better manner; and<lb/>
we have greatly increased our means of extinguishing fires<lb/>
by the introduction of the Croton into our streets, but our<lb/>
neighbor, Brooklyn, only requires a torch to be applied to<lb/>
one of her tinder houses during a dry north-wester, to be laid<lb/>
in ruins in a very few hours. They have whole streets of<lb/>
slight wooden houses, which could only be saved from burn-<lb/>
ing by being pulled down, while their supply of water is ex-<lb/>
ceedingly limited. It is owing more to good luck than good<lb/>
management that they have not already been reduced to<lb/>
ashes.<lb/>
Instead of feeling astonishment at the occurrence of an ex-<lb/>
tensive conflagration in any of our cities, we should rather be<lb/>
amazed at the non-occurrence of such an event.<lb/>
BROADWAY.<lb/>
Willis calls the Castle Garden “the amputated toe of<lb/>
Broadway.” When observing the general arrangement of this<lb/>
our Gotham, I always think of Gulliver when he fell asleep<lb/>
upon the plains of Lilliput, and the Lilliputians fastened him<lb/>
to the ground by his hair. Castle Garden suggests Lemuel’s<lb/>
head; the bridge, his neck; Broadway up to the Park, his<lb/>
body ; the remainder of Broadway, his left leg; Park Row,<lb/>
Chatham street, and the Bowery, represent his right leg;<lb/>
two long slips, that stretch out into the East River and the<lb/>
Hudson, his arms; the great iron pipes that convey the Cro-<lb/>
ton and the Gas, his great arteries; the service-pipes, his<lb/>
smaller blood-vessels; and, by the recent establishment of<lb/>
Morse's telegraphic wires, the imaginary giant has been fur-<lb/>
nished with nerves.<lb/>
Let us stand for a moment, on the battlements of Castle<lb/>
Garden—in other words, on the giant’s forehead.<lb/>
What a scene is this! The waters of the Atlantic are at<lb/>
our feet. Who knows how far these bright blue waves,<lb/>
have rolled to visit us this morning. See how their tiny<lb/>
ridges reflect the flying clouds! How gracefully they bear<lb/>
up these “ white winged ships”—the angels or messengers<lb/>
of our national Commerce—as they enter this noble bay, not<lb/>
dealing death and destruction in their path, as in former days,<lb/>
but freighted with the productions of many a clime, from the<lb/>
iron of northern Russia to the spices of Ceylon! See the<lb/>
leafless forest that surrounds our wharves as if it grew out<lb/>
of the water, its culminating points piercing the sky like the<lb/>
spears of an army of Titans. You can hear, at this distance,<lb/>
the clicking cogs of a hundred windlasses, loading and un-<lb/>
loading a hundred ships. Hundreds have recently arrived:<lb/>
—hundreds are about to set sail. Owners, captains, consign-<lb/>
ers, provision-merchants, passengers and crews are moving<lb/>
busily around these masts. Only a low dull murmur reaches<lb/>
us here, from their many thousand tongues, and their foot-<lb/>
steps on the sounding decks. But most prominent, perhaps,<lb/>
among the objects that attract attention, are the little steam-<lb/>
ers that ply hither and thither, snorting and choking as they<lb/>
paddle along, and giving noisy animation to the scene.<lb/>
Steamers of a much larger class, fitted for navigating the<lb/>
Sound, and belonging to the Norwich and Stonington lines,<lb/>
lie alongside the pier to our right. Around the landing-place,<lb/>
the crowd of cabmen is dense. The old “Massachusetts”<lb/>
has just arrived. She is letting off her steam; and the loud,<lb/>
continuous roar, mingling with the shouts of cabmen, police-<lb/>
men, and jackalls from the Hotels, sounds as though King<lb/>
Acohis and his subject Eurus were quarrelling at the mouth<lb/>
of the storm-cave, while Notus and his other brethren, mem-<lb/>
bers of the tempestuous cabinet, complete the hoarse quin-<lb/>
tette by exerting their highly effective windpipes. One<lb/>
glance more at Staten Island, Governor’s Island, and the<lb/>
other two, Bedlow and Gibbet, South Brooklyn and the Jer-<lb/>
sey shore—landscape and waterscape together. We must<lb/>
be gone. Somebody will be complaining pettishly that all<lb/>
this is irrelevant, and that not one word has been said about<lb/>
Broadway.<lb/>
Let us now walk along the giant’s neck to his collar-bone<lb/>
—the farther limit of the Battery-green. His neck, indeed,<lb/>
might at first sight appear to be wry : but the truth is, the<lb/>
huge ante-diluvian is merely bending his head, listening to<lb/>
the music of the sea.<lb/></ab></div>

<div><head><title>THE PARK.</title></head></div>
<div><ab>The English and the French have not yet decided whether<lb/>
London or Paris is the head-quarters of European civilization.<lb/>
There can be no doubt with regard to the head-quarters of<lb/>
civilization in America. To this distinction New-York has<lb/>
an undisputed claim; and the Park is the centre of New-<lb/>
York. In that highly-respectable-looking building, the City<lb/>
Hall, Law, on which all civilization is founded, rears its aw-<lb/>
ful head, unwigged. In Canton and Calcutta—in Mexico<lb/>
and Guatimala, people talk of "the Park." Everybody who<lb/>
comes to New-York, makes the Park the nucleus around<lb/>
which all his ideas of Gothamian localities arrange them-<lb/>
selves. There! the fire-bell tolls! It is a solemn, porten-<lb/>
tous sound! Already the engines are rattling along the<lb/>
rough street One would think the firemen must stand on<lb/>
the qui vive from morning to night, and from night to morn-<lb/>
ing, with their engines on the pavement, and the ropes in<lb/>
their hands, ready to start at the first note of alarm, and ar-<lb/>
ray the elements each other—water against fire. See<lb/>

THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.<lb/>
how the school-boys fly across the gravelled walks, leaving<lb/>
their cricket-bats and balls, to find out where the blaze is!<lb/>
Red-flannel shirts, and glazed hats—mitre-crowned, quaker-<lb/>
brimmed—lead the way. Hurrah ! it is a glorious time for<lb/>
these young fellows ! Their hot blood beats high in their<lb/>
pulses. The reaction, after this excitement, will cool the<lb/>
fever in their veins ; and, if the fever did not waste itself<lb/>
on a few such things as these, the community might feel its<lb/>
effects in some less venial encroachments upon the public<lb/>
peace.<lb/>
That fountain !—we must not forget to speak of the foun-<lb/>
tain, now shaped like a fan, then like an umbrella—now<lb/>
dancing in mid-air, then falling in silver spray into the basin<lb/>
below. Of how many beautiful things it is an emblem!<lb/>
How suggestive of pure thoughts—of holy aspirations ! It is<lb/>
the “genius loci”—the good genius of the place. Who knows<lb/>
the extent of its humanizing influences upon the tens of thou-<lb/>
sands who gaze upon it as they pass? We living things,<lb/>
called men,—we insulated spirits, bottled up in matter, and<lb/>
floating down the resistless stream—are wondrously affected<lb/>
by externals. The physical and the intellectual—the visible<lb/>
and the invisible—the tangible and the immaterial, are full of<lb/>
analogies, coincidences, and harmonies. But, as this article<lb/>
is intended to be read, it will be expedient so eschew meta-<lb/>
physics.<lb/>
Here are thirty coaches in a line, and thirty coachmen<lb/>
looking out for fares—most of them whistling, as sailors do,<lb/>
when they want to raise the wind. I often wonder whether<lb/>
it is possible that the majority of these loafers can earn<lb/>
enough in a day to buy grease for their axles. It is almost<lb/>
an event to see one of them getting a job ; and yet here they<lb/>
stand, winter and summer, in storm and sunshine, mending<lb/>
their whips and quarrelling about the next nomination to the<lb/>
presidency. The motto of the Epicurean is “a short life and<lb/>
a merry one the motto of these hackmen is—a long life<lb/>
and a lazy one.<lb/></ab></div>

<div><ab>During a walk of ten minutes, to meet five or six thousand<lb/>
people, each moving along with a separate purpose, is cal-<lb/>
culated to awake reflection in the dullest. A few years ago,<lb/>
all these men and women were little children, amusing<lb/>
themselves with tops and skipping ropes, and going to<lb/>
school: a few years hence, they will all know how much of<lb/>
our current theology is based upon eternal truth—how much<lb/>
upon the false and flimsy theories of men: for they will be<lb/>
among those unseen realities, on which we too often descant<lb/>
so thoughtlessly and speculate so absurdly. This is an idea<lb/>
with which all are familiar; but its vast bearings are mea-<lb/>
sured only by a few.<lb/>
Omnibuses—omnibuses—omnibuses! what a convenience!<lb/>
what a nuisance! Go back for a moment to the time of<lb/>
Abraham, and the patriarchal institutions on which all soci-<lb/>
ety is based. Think of dwelling in tents, and believing in<lb/>
astrology, and riding on camels. Then think of a crowd of<lb/>
people rushing down Broadway in four-wheeled boxes, drawn<lb/>
by the degenerate representatives of Arabian coursers. The<lb/>
effect of contrast in time, place, and circumstance is amusing,<lb/>
you will admit. Abraham flourished in the nineteenth cen-<lb/>
tury before the Christian era,—we, in the nineteenth century<lb/>
after it. What stirring dramas have been enacted during the<lb/>
long interval! Nineteen centuries more, and antiquaries<lb/>
will perhaps be rambling with their note books among the<lb/>
scarce distinguishable ruins of this great city, and inquiring<lb/>
i<lb/>
of the herdsmen, who shall feed their flocks between Harlem<lb/>
and the Battery, concerning the whereabouts of the ancient<lb/>

It was but the other day that I chanced to be crossing the<lb/>
gloomy vestibule of the Palais de Justice, called with much<lb/>
reason the Hall des Pas Perdus. The door leading to the<lb/>
different court rooms, opened on a large platform, chequered<lb/>
with grey and black stones. It was the hour of opening the<lb/>
courts, and several hundred persons were passing to and fro;<lb/>
the scraping of their feet, mingling with the dull sound of<lb/>
voices, echoed from the wall of the vaulted building.<lb/>
The advocates a robe neuve carried under their arms enor-<lb/>
mous bundles of papers. On the other hand, the members of<lb/>
the bar who were shabbily dressed, burdened themselves<lb/>
with nothing, except perhaps a small roll, which brought to<lb/>
mind the baton of the marshals of France. Some of these car-<lb/>
ried the luxury of carelessness in attire to a singular excess. I<lb/>
observed particularly, one gown with sad rents in the back,<lb/>
and sleeves fringed with tatters ; the lining presented a curi-<lb/>
ous sample of all the shades, aided by grease, dust, and long<lb/>
wearing, to an original ground of black. I hastened to see<lb/>
who wore a garment so nearly in rags, and was surprised to<lb/>
recognise one of our best and most celebrated lawyers. I<lb/>
complimented him gravely on his costume.<lb/>
“ I should hardly have known the most famous of our ad-<lb/>
vocates,” said I, “but I comprehend : the degree of rustiness<lb/>
of costume designates the degree of celebrity ; the holes in<lb/>
your toga serve, in your order, for epaulettes and marks of<lb/>
distinction. The common soldiers have new robes—the ge-<lb/>
nerals old and torn ones..”<lb/>
He smiled and replied, “This is the first and only gown I<lb/>
have ever worn. I should not feel at ease in a new one; and<lb/>
would not plead without this old friend upon my shoulders.<lb/>
Indeed, it troubles me, I assure you, to be even under the<lb/>
necessity of having it patched."<lb/>
“ I can easily believe that,” said I, casting an eye over<lb/>
the tattered covering.<lb/>
“ And what are you doing here ?" asked he, “ you cannot<lb/>
be engaged in a suit, or I should be the first to be informed,<lb/>
—eh !”<lb/>
“Certainly,” I replied, “ chance alone brings me into the<lb/>
Hall des Pas-Perdus. I confess to you I have a horror of law<lb/>
suits : the very sight of a brief makes me shudder.”<lb/>
“ You are wrong. The annals of law contain more of the<lb/>
dramatic—more of the romantic and thrilling, than the most<lb/>
fertile imagination could supply. Every one of its pages is a<lb/>
history of intense interest. Open at hazard, read the first<lb/>
lines, and you find what will move you to mirth, melt you to<lb/>
tears, or cause you to grow pale with terror.”<lb/>
While speaking, the lawyer introduced the tip of his fin-<lb/>
ger, at hazard, between two leaves of a volume he held, and<lb/>
THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.<lb/>
261<pb n="261"/><lb/>
opened it. “Just as I said!” cried he, “ Look here ; chapter<lb/>
3d, paragraph 138,—here we are in the midst of deep trage-<lb/>
dy. I have ten minutes yet, before my cause comes on; so I<lb/>
will tell you a story which the sight of this article brings to<lb/>
mind.”<lb/>
“ In 1812, a young man, son of a colonel, who was killed<lb/>
in battle, lived with his mother in the fifth story of a house,<lb/>
in the rue Coquenard. Being the widow’s only son, he was<lb/>
exempted from military service, much to his regret, for Gus-<lb/>
tave Remicourt, like others at that time, had dreamed of bat-<lb/>
tles, and the rewards of victory; the epaulettes of a general,<lb/>
or a cross from the emperor’s own hands. His mother, whose<lb/>
only means of support was a small pension allowed her as<lb/>
the widow of an officer, old and infirm, and dependent on her<lb/>
son’s daily cares, always wept when he talked of going to<lb/>
the wars. He therefore stifled his regrets in his own breast,<lb/>
and applied himself to his duties with affectionate zeal, per-<lb/>
forming every day the monotonous services of a clerk to the<lb/>
minister of finance. He never quitted his mother, except for<lb/>
the bureau, and returned as soon as he was at liberty.<lb/>
“ At the time of the Russian campaign Madame Remicourt<lb/>
could no longer get her pension paid ; and a hundred francs<lb/>
a month, the salary of Gustave, was hardly sufficient for their<lb/>
maintenance in the most humble manner! The poor invalid<lb/>
tried to assist her son; but the effort only increased her ma-<lb/>
lady to such a degree, that it was soon dangerous to leave<lb/>
her alone. Gustave was reduced to the alternative of giving<lb/>
up his clerkship, or of hiring a nurse.<lb/>
“The porters know all that passes in any part of their<lb/>
houses. In spite of the care taken by Madame Remicourt<lb/>
and her son to conceal their hapless condition, it was known<lb/>
to all their neighbors. These had looked upon her as their<lb/>
superior in rank and education, and had always observed to-<lb/>
wards her a guarded respect, not only due to the rank of her<lb/>
late husband, but imposed by her well dignified manner.<lb/>
The knowledge that she needed assistance, encouraged these<lb/>
good people to offer their services ; and two or three of the<lb/>
females at length established themselves as regular nurses.<lb/>
“ Among these obliging but officious friends, was a young<lb/>
Italian, the widow of a Piedmontese captain, who had per-<lb/>
ished like Colonel Remicourt, in the service of France. Ma-<lb/>
dame Giuseppa Vicento was beautiful, and possessed a de-<lb/>
gree of talent and quickness of perception, which often sup-<lb/>
plies to a certain extent, the defects of education. She was a<lb/>
Neapolitan, and did not hesitate to acknowledge that her<lb/>
husband had chosen her from the lowest rank of the people.<lb/>
Her singular and noble style of beauty, and the grace of her<lb/>
carriage, fully justified the captain’s love. She was extreme-<lb/>
ly attentive to Madame Remicourt, who, on her part, con-<lb/>
ceived for her a sentimeat of real friendship. The young<lb/>
Italian became her privileged nurse. While Gustave was<lb/>
absent at the bureau, she remained with his mother, and<lb/>
wailed upon her with almost filial solicitude. She knew<lb/>
how to divert the sufferer from melancholy thoughts, and to<lb/>
cheer her with the hope of belter days: while listening to<lb/>
her sweet and animating voice, Gustave felt no longer sad<lb/>
or discouraged. Every morning he left her with regret; at<lb/>
evening he hastened to return, and always found her by his<lb/>
mother's side.<lb/>
“The space is not wide between gratitude and love, in<lb/>
the heart of a young man of twenty; Gustave was soon des-<lb/>
perately enamored of the fair Italian, nor could he at all<lb/>
times conceal his passion. But the calm demeanor of Giu-<lb/>
seppa, the veneration with which she inspired him, and the<lb/>
timidity that always attends first love, prevented its avowal.<lb/>
Meantime Giuseppa seemed to read his thoughts; for her<lb/>
reserve towards him increased, and she more frequently<lb/>
mentioned the name of her late husband.<lb/>
“ This conduct, by depriving him of hope, but rendered<lb/>
more violent his passion. A smile from her sufficed to throw<lb/>
him in raptures: and when she was colder than usual, he<lb/>
would relapse into the deepest gloom. The signora seemed<lb/>
unconscious of her power over Gustave: and whenever Ma-<lb/>
dame Remicourt, uneasy on her son’s account, alluded to it,<lb/>
she would turn the conversation with admirable address.<lb/>
“ The condition of the invalid suddenly became alarming.<lb/>
The physician who visited her did not conceal his apprehen-<lb/>
sions from Giuseppa. and one morning, urged by Gustave s<lb/>
questions, she informed him that his mothers end was near.<lb/>
Struck by the dreadful intelligence, the young man sunk into<lb/>
a chair, rigid and insensible. His mother saw him and was<lb/>
terrified; she sprang from her bed, and called his name with <lb/>
her dying voice : Gustave recalled to sense by the sound,<lb/>
hastened to support her in his arms; she sank upon his<lb/>
breast, and breathed her last sigh.<lb/>
“The bereaved son was seized with convulsions; the<lb/>
neighbors were obliged to tear him from his mother’s corpse,<lb/>
and remove him to a neighboring room. For many days he<lb/>
lay between life and death, prostrated by a brain fever. On<lb/>
the fifteenth day reason returned ; the first name he uttered<lb/>
was his mother’s; the first person he recognised was Giu-<lb/>
seppa; she had watched by him during the severest parox-<lb/>
ysms of his illness. She had taken on herself the duty of at-<lb/>
tending to the burial of his mother, and had even sold some<lb/>
jewels of her own to defray the expenses of the funeral.<lb/>
“ ‘ He could only bathe the hand of Giuseppa with tears,<lb/>
and cover it with passionate kisses. She did not withdraw<lb/>
the hand; neither did she change the conduct she had adopt-<lb/>
ed towards him. As his health was gradually re-established,<lb/>
she saw him less and less frequently. Gustave earnestly<lb/>
longed to ask the reason of this reserve, but he was not yet<lb/>
quite prepared to make an avowal of his love.<lb/>
“At last he was well enough to return to his duties at the<lb/>
bureau. One evening, a day having passed without seeing<lb/>
Giuseppa, he summoned courage to go to her lodgings, and<lb/>
ask her to accompany him to Ins mother’s grave. The sig-<lb/>
nora, without hesitation, wrapped herself in a shawl and took<lb/>
his arm.<lb/>
“When they came to the cemetery, and the bereaved<lb/>
youth had read the name of his mother, carved on a wooden<lb/>
cross, he fell on his knees, and relieved the oppression of his<lb/>
heart by a hurst of tears. He then rose, and offering his hand<lb/>
to the Italian, said:<lb/>
“ I am now alone in the world; alone! for you love me<lb/>
not, madame!’<lb/>
“ She raised her hand, and looked at him fixedly, but did<lb/>
not reply.<lb/>
“Why did you not suffer me to die?' he asked. ‘What<lb/>
would you have me do with the wretched life you have pre-<lb/>
served ?’<lb/>
“She smiled pensively, and said—‘A few months of ab-<lb/>
sence will cure you of this : it is more in your head than in<lb/>
your heart. The loneliness of your condition since your mo-<lb/>
ther’s death, has caused you to feel the need of attaching your-<lb/>
self to some one, and I chanced to be the first—the only per-<lb/>
son who was near you.’<lb/>
“ Oh spare me ! do not rend my heart!’ cried he in a voice<lb/>
of despair.<lb/>
“Listen to me,’she resumed. ‘Love, with us Italians,<lb/>
is not a feeble, fleeting sentiment, content with little. He<lb/>
that I love, shall be the idol of my life; for him I would joy-<lb/>
fully sacrifice existence—happiness—conscience, itself! Thus<lb/>
will I love; thus would I be loved.’<lb/>
“And do I not love you thus?’<lb/>
“You believe so—but I repeat, you love me not. I will<lb/>
prove you, Monsieur Gustave. I am very poor; to pay the<lb/>
last duties to your mother, I sold the jewels which were my<lb/>
last resource. If it were necessary—to save me from misery,<lb/>
from hunger—to commit a crime, could you ? You tremble,<lb/>
you grow pale! Reassure yourself: I was only jesting. You<lb/>
see plainly that your love is all a delusion.’<lb/>
“ Giuseppa then began to walk homeward, without taking<lb/>
Gustave’s arm. He remained standing, with his head droop-<lb/>
ed upon his breast.<lb/>
“For two days, he avoided the Italian ; at the end of that<lb/>
time, he entered her apartment. She was sitting before a<lb/>
table, embroidering, without her shawl, though the weather<lb/>
was cold, and with but little fire on the hearth.<lb/>
“Gustave laid on the table a banknote worth five hundred<lb/>
francs. ‘ I have anticipated part of my year’s salary,’ said<lb/>
he with sorrowful pride.<lb/>
“ 'It is well,’ answered she quietly; ‘I can buy another<lb/>
shawl. I sold mine this morning for bread.’ She regarded<lb/>
him at the same time with an expressive look, as much as to<lb/>
say—‘ As I sold my jewels to bury your mother.’<lb/>
“'You are right—Alas!’ cried he; ‘I have hardly yet ful-<lb/>
filled a mere duty. How will you prove my gratitude and<lb/>
love?'<lb/>
“ She smiled disdainfully, without raising her head, and an-<lb/>
swered, ‘ were I in your place, I should have no need to ask.’<lb/>
" ‘ Giuseppa!’<lb/>
" ' I was never loved but once. He who loved me was poor;<lb/>
but bavin" seen me he won for me rank, opulence, and hap-<lb/>
piness ; he counted nothing; stopped at nothing; so I was<lb/>
262<pb n="262"/><lb/>
THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.<lb/>
proud to bear his name—and adore him as a deity.’<lb/>
“ ' But you repel my love; you plunge me into despair.<lb/>
Consent to become my wife ; I feel that I shall then toil with<lb/>
an ardor that must ensure success.’<lb/>
“ ' Oh yes!’ interrupted she, ironically, ' during the week,<lb/>
I should be the servant of your humble lodgings ; on Sunday<lb/>
I should, perhaps, have the recreation of a walk ; my ideal<lb/>
of the future would be the hope of your obtaining one day,<lb/>
perchance, the situation of head-clerk !'<lb/>
" ' But in mercy, Giuseppa, tell me what I must do ?’<lb/>
“ ' Act, and do not talk about it. Vicento would have found<lb/>
out.’ ”<lb/>
Here my friend the advocate was silent a few moments.<lb/>
“ Six months after,” resumed he, “ I was invited to a ball<lb/>
at the house of the Signora Giuseppa. She lived in a rich<lb/>
hotel in the Rue de l’Universite, and all Paris talked of the<lb/>
splendor of her entertainments. I could not help observing,<lb/>
that evening, the extreme paleness and agitation of M. Remi-<lb/>
court. He was continually falling into gloomy reveries, from<lb/>
which he would start suddenly, glancing about him with a<lb/>
look of terror. At other times he would gaze fixedly at per-<lb/>
sons in company, yet seem unconscious of their presence.<lb/>
" The queen of the festivities was the beautiful Italian.<lb/>
Dressed superbly, and blazing with jewels, she yielded her-<lb/>
self with girlish delight to the pleasure of the dance. Some-<lb/>
times, in passing Gustave, she would throw on him a smiling<lb/>
glance, and then his whole face would light up with joy ; but<lb/>
when she was gone, he relapsed into gloom. This singular<lb/>
conduct was easily explained ; it was generally understood<lb/>
that he was an unsuccessful wooer of the lovely widow. This<lb/>
I learned from the observations of persons near me.<lb/>
“ After that, I lost sight for a year, of M. de Remicourt and<lb/>
Giuseppa. I had just made my debut at the bar, with con-<lb/>
siderable success. My professional engagements condemned<lb/>
me to incessant labor, and left me no leisure to mingle in fash-<lb/>
ionable gaieties. One morning I received a note; a woman<lb/>
begged me to stop at the Conciergerie, where she was im-<lb/>
prisoned. This woman was Giuseppa.”<lb/>
At this moment an attorney came out of the first chamber,<lb/>
and hastening towards us, informed my companion that his<lb/>
cause had come on.<lb/>
“ Hang the cause,” cried I “ I want the rest of your story.”<lb/>
“ You shall have it some other time,” said my friend, and<lb/>
adjusting his tattered gown, he entered the court room. I<lb/>
followed and listened with great interest to his admirable<lb/>
pleading.<lb/>
At eight the court adjourned. The advocate then took me<lb/>
by the arm, and went out, continuing the story as if he had<lb/>
not been interrupted.<lb/>
“ I found Giuseppa in prison, but dressed with the taste<lb/>
which had always characterised her. She smiled, reached<lb/>
me her hand, invited me to sit down, and did the honors of<lb/>
her cell with as much grace as I had seen her do the honors<lb/>
of her salon.<lb/>
“I took a seat, and waited for the fair Italian to explain<lb/>
the cause of her arrest, and her motive in sending for me.<lb/>
“At length she said—‘ Monsieur, though yet young, you<lb/>
have a high reputation among the members of the bar in<lb/>
Paris. I think, also, I have had the pleasure of meeting you<lb/>
sometimes in society, and even of receiving you at my house.<lb/>
For these reasons I have recourse to you in the embarrass-<lb/>
ment caused by my sudden arrest. May I count upon your<lb/>
assistance ?’<lb/>
“All this was said with an ease, calmness, and even a<lb/>
levity, that showed not the least disquiet of mind.<lb/>
“ I bowed my head in sign of assent.<lb/>
" ‘ How do the laws of France,’ she continued, ' punish the<lb/>
crime of counterfeiting bank-notes?’<lb/>
“ I showed her a paper containing the words—‘ the pun-<lb/>
ishment of forgery shall be death.'<lb/>
: ' But,’ cried she with a smile, ‘ here is another clause a<lb/>
little below. ‘ The law rewards the informer.’<lb/>
“ I read her the following paragraph:—' Art. 148. Persons<lb/>
guilty of the crimes mentioned in articles 132 and 133, shall<lb/>
be exempted from punishment, provided, before prosecution,<lb/>
they give information of the crimes, and discover the chief<lb/>
criminals to the proper authorities; or if, even after the<lb/>
commencement of a prosecution against them, they furnish<lb/>
such information as shall procure the arrest of other guilty<lb/>
persons.’<lb/>
“With a slight but graceful gesture, she twined her slen-<lb/>
der fingers in her beautiful dark hair. ' Ah!’ she exclaimed,<lb/>
' the law pardons the informer! Thanks—and adieu, Mon-<lb/>
sieur l’avocat.’<lb/>
“ The same evening, the friend who had accompanied me<lb/>
to Giuseppa’s ball, informed me that Gustave Remicourt had<lb/>
been arrested, upon what charge no one could divine. Alas!<lb/>
I divined but too well! the next day, with my friend, I vis-<lb/>
ited the young man in prison. He appeared calm, though<lb/>
not altogether unconcerned. ' My arrest,’ said he, " is caused<lb/>
by some mistake. There does not exist the least proof<lb/>
against me.’<lb/>
" ' Monsieur,’ I asked, ' do you know the articles in the<lb/>
code relative to the crime of forgery ?’<lb/>
" ' No, monsieur,’ he replied.<lb/>
“ The law exempts from all punishment, those who inform<lb/>
against their accomplices.’<lb/>
" ‘If I had accomplices,’ answered he coolly, 'I would suf-<lb/>
fer death a thousand times, rather than betray them.’<lb/>
" ' But think you, others would observe the like generosity<lb/>
towards you ?’<lb/>
" ' You know my secret, monsieur,’ he murmured with a<lb/>
broken voice.<lb/>
" ' Are you not the victim of an accusation ?’<lb/>
" ' Giuseppa!—of hers !—oh no ! I would not believe her<lb/>
capable of such baseness ! Oh no ! chance has put justice on<lb/>
the traces of my crime.’<lb/>
" ' Why had you not recourse to flight, when you heard of<lb/>
her arrest ? You had time to save yourself.’<lb/>
" ' Because I wished to save her. This very night the guards<lb/>
of the Conciergerie, gained over by gold, had promised to loos-<lb/>
en the bars of Giuseppa’s window, and aid her escape. I<lb/>
should then have carried her to England. Ah ! I regret the<lb/>
loss of liberty and life only for her sake ! But I will yet save<lb/>
her, monsieur ! Before my judges I will assume myself the<lb/>
whole of the guilt of the crime charged against her. Poor<lb/>
Giuseppa !’<lb/>
" After his arrest Gustave saw the Italian but once ; and<lb/>
that was when the judge who committed him caused them<lb/>
to be brought together in his presence. Prudence, and his<lb/>
resolution to save Giuseppa, enabled him to restrain his emo-<lb/>
tions.<lb/>
" When, on the trial, he saw her come into court, he could<lb/>
not conceal his agitation ; but uttering a faint cry, stretched<lb/>
out his hands towards her. She passed close by him, her<lb/>
eyes fixed on the ground; and took her place, not with the<lb/>
accused, but among the witnesses. Gustave looked at her,<lb/>
and sank back on his seat. The judges entered at that mo-<lb/>
ment, and the court was opened.<lb/>
" The first witness called was Giuseppa. She confessed<lb/>
her part in the crime charged against Remicourt, and fur-<lb/>
nished the most incontrovertible details respecting the issue<lb/>
of the false bills. Frequently the murmurs of the specta-<lb/>
tors interrupted without in the least discomposing her. Gus-<lb/>
tave listened in silence, and when the president interrogated<lb/>
him, only replied, ' All that madame has said is true.’<lb/>
“ The depositions being taken, and the procureur-general<lb/>
having spoken, I rose in my turn. I endeavored to show-<lb/>
that there were extenuating circumstances to be taken into<lb/>
view on behalf of my unfortunate client, who had evidently<lb/>
been enticed into crime by the woman who had betrayed him.<lb/>
But he interrupted my pleading.<lb/>
" ' My guilt is proved,’ he said with firmness; 'I have<lb/>
confessed it; let my sentence be pronounced.’<lb/>
" The prisoner was condemned to death, but the verdict<lb/>
being accompanied by a recommendation to mercy, his pun-<lb/>
ishment was commuted to imprisonment for life.<lb/>
" The next day I visited Remicourt, in company with a<lb/>
friend, who gave him a bible, under the cover of which was<lb/>
concealed a poison.<lb/>
" ' I thank you,’ said Gustave, ‘but I will not avail myself<lb/>
of this means of escape from infamy. I have yet a duty to<lb/>
fulfil before leaving this world.’<lb/>
“I offered to appeal from the judgment, and procure a new<lb/>
trial, but he obstinately refused his consent. Eight days<lb/>
after he departed for the galleys, wearing the dress and load-<lb/>
ed with the chains of the galley-slaves. Giuseppa was set<lb/>
at liberty the day after the trial. She immediately sent to<lb/>
the prison of Remicourt, means to facilitate his escape ; but<lb/>
he refused to use them.<lb/>
" You remember the exciting political events from 1812, to<lb/>
1816 ?—the invasion of France, the taking of Paris, the resto-<lb/>
ration, the return from Elba, the hundred days, Waterloo,<lb/>
and finally the second return of the Bourbons. In the tu-<lb/>
THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.<lb/>
263<pb n="263"/><lb/>
mult of these stupendous events, Gustave and Giuseppa pas-<lb/>
sed from my recollection.<lb/>
“One evening at the carnival, in 1817, fatigued with a<lb/>
week of unusual labor, I went in search of recreation and di-<lb/>
version, to a ball at Frascati’s, resolving to play the idler for<lb/>
at least a few hours. The crowd became so compact and so<lb/>
disorderly, that I was forced against the wall of one of the<lb/>
salons, and nearly crushed to death, when a mask came to<lb/>
my relief, and with powerful efforts forcing a way through<lb/>
the living mass, carried me into a room where, thanks to his<lb/>
attentions, I soon recovered recollection and breath. I ex-<lb/>
pressed my gratitude for this timely assistance, and begged<lb/>
my preserver to tell me his name, or let me see his face ;<lb/>
but he answered only by an imperative gesture enjoining si-<lb/>
lence, and leaving the cabinet, disappeared in the crowd. I<lb/>
had only time to notice the whiteness of his hands, and a<lb/>
large diamond ring on his finger.<lb/>
“It would have been prudent to have quitted the hall at<lb/>
once, and returned home; but I continued to enjoy with a<lb/>
sort of childish pleasure, the gaiety of a scene that had so<lb/>
nearly proved fatal to me.<lb/>
“ Ere long I noticed a lady magnificently wearing on her<lb/>
head a coronet of diamonds. The splendor of her dress was<lb/>
lost in her beauty, which was heightened by an air of noble-<lb/>
ness and majesty, that commanded universal attention. It<lb/>
was Giuseppa ! She cast her eyes upon me, but the indiffer-<lb/>
ence of her look caused me to think she had not recognised<lb/>
me.<lb/>
“ As for me, the sight of her inspired me with such unea-<lb/>
siness and horror, that I quilted the hall, and went to the<lb/>
rooms where gaming parlies were at play. The sight of<lb/>
gold, the emotions of the players, and the various fortunes<lb/>
of the game, filled me with a kind of intoxication ; I could<lb/>
not resist the temptation of joining them. I lost; but losing<lb/>
at cards only urges to the trial of new chances; I continued<lb/>
to play, anxious and breathless, as fortune continued unfavor-<lb/>
able to me, when I felt a hand laid on my shoulder. I turn-<lb/>
ed quickly, ashamed of having been surprised at a gaming<lb/>
table by one of my friends, and saw the black domino that<lb/>
had rescued me in the early part of the evening.<lb/>
“ ‘ You owe me your life, monsieur,’ said he, ' I will now<lb/>
render you another service equally great; play no more ! It<lb/>
is not in the violent and vulgar emotions excited at cards<lb/>
that you should spend your mental activity. Reserve all<lb/>
your energies for success at the bar, and leave gaming to<lb/>
unfortunate wretches reduced by fate to this refuge from<lb/>
thought.’<lb/>
“ While I regarded him with surprise, he put into my<lb/>
hands the bank-note that I had just laid on the table, and<lb/>
taking from his pocket a handful of gold threw it down at<lb/>
hazard before the roulette. He gained ; in ten minutes I had<lb/>
recovered my losses, and the black domino had acquired a<lb/>
considerable sum.<lb/>
“I retired, but remained standing among the crowd, cu-<lb/>
rious to see more of the person who had rendered me such<lb/>
services. His figure was concealed in the large folds of a do-<lb/>
mino of black satin, his face bidden by a mask of the same<lb/>
hue. closed tightly ; his beard flowed down upon his breast.<lb/>
He seemed at once to defy and govern chance; for during<lb/>
several hours, he was invariably a winner. By degree the<lb/>
rumor of his singular fortune spread to the ball room, and<lb/>
numbers came out to see 'he man who seemed thus possess-<lb/>
ed of magical powers. He showed no emotion at finding<lb/>
himself the object of general curiosity. Suddenly, however,<lb/>
he was seized with a violent convulsive trembling; I rushed<lb/>
to his side, and supported him ; he would else have fallen to<lb/>
the ground.<lb/>
‘ Take me away—for pity !’ murmured he. faintly. I forc-<lb/>
ed my way out of the room, dragging him along, and leaving<lb/>
large sums of his money on the table.<lb/>
“In a few minutes he recovered his composure. He rose<lb/>
quickly, disengaged himself from my arm, and laughed bit-<lb/>
terly, and as I thought, convulsively. ‘Ah!' he exclaimed,<lb/>
'at last the hour has struck—the hour!’<lb/>
' You assisted me: I thank you, and have yet a request to<lb/>
make. Take these bills which I have just won, and restore<lb/>
them only to me, or to the person who will give you the<lb/>
name engraved in the inside of this watch, which I also de-<lb/>
posite in your hands.’<lb/>
" He gave me his pocket-book, placed his watch in my<lb/>
hand, and hastened back to the card table. His luck had<lb/>
not abandoned him, even during his absence. Everybody<lb/>
looked at him in astonishment, and almost with superstitious<lb/>
fear. While gathering up the money he had gained, he<lb/>
cast his eyes around, and fixed them on Giuseppa, who had<lb/>
come with others to see the wonderful player.<lb/>
‘Will you play, Madame?’ he asked.<lb/>
“ She smiled, and put into the hands of a gentleman who<lb/>
was with her a purse of gold, which he staked. Fortune<lb/>
ceased to be favorable to the masked player. He lost all he<lb/>
had won since he returned to the table.<lb/>
‘I have brought you ill luck,’said Giuseppa.<lb/>
‘Ah!’ replied he with a gesture of indifference, ‘ I cannot<lb/>
have two pleasures at once, and I prefer that of looking at<lb/>
you to the insipid one of winning gold.’<lb/>
“ She gave a slight toss of her head. ‘ But’ added the<lb/>
mask, ‘fortune will befriend me again, if I wish it.’<lb/>
“ He threw his last bank note on the table. The boast<lb/>
was verified ; he was once more a winner.<lb/>
‘You are a magician!’ cried Giuseppa: the mask was<lb/>
looking fixedly at her.<lb/>
‘If you please,’ said he, ‘I will show you my secret for<lb/>
commanding fortune.’<lb/>
“ She hesitated a few moments before quitting the arm of<lb/>
her escort, but at last made a step towards the unknown.<lb/>
He was at her side in an instant, and threw the gold in his<lb/>
hands among the crowd surrounding the table. This of<lb/>
course caused a scuffle and confusion, in the midst of which<lb/>
the black mask seized the arm of the Italian, and drew her<lb/>
towards the ball room. I followed unobserved, but so close<lb/>
behind them that I could not help hearing what they said.<lb/>
The language of the mask was that of a man passionately<lb/>
enamored.<lb/>
‘I have long loved you’—faltered he; ‘ long watched your<lb/>
movements, long followed your steps. My heart, hand, for-<lb/>
tune, are devoted to you. A voice that never decieves, tells<lb/>
me that we have been affianced for years. Yousee, I can<lb/>
dispose of fate as I choose !’<lb/>
‘ Ha!’ she cried with some appearance of agitation—<lb/>
‘ would you have me regard as serious the pleasantries of a<lb/>
masked ball ?’<lb/>
‘ My words are serious: I repeat it, we are affianced;<lb/>
nothing shall separate us in future.’<lb/>
“ At this moment, the musicians began to play a waltz;<lb/>
the mask encircled with his arm the waist of the Italian,<lb/>
and drew her among the dancers. The circle was but small,<lb/>
so that every few moments, in the measure, Giuseppa and<lb/>
her partner were brought close to me, and I heard much of<lb/>
what they said. With a kind of strange intuition, I compre-<lb/>
hended the sense of these interrupted words, heard as it<lb/>
were by stealth, amidst the noise of the crowd,, the tumultu-<lb/>
ous clamor of voices, and the music of the orchestra.<lb/>
'Ah—you do not know me?’ said the mask. ‘But I<lb/>
know you well; I know the smallest details of your whole<lb/>
life; I will tell them if you choose.—Dance Giuseppa, I<lb/>
should say—Madame Vicento!’<lb/>
“ Giuseppa started, and placed her hand on her breast.<lb/>
‘I feel a prick in my side,’ she exclaimed ; ‘a pin is hurting<lb/>
me.'<lb/>
“ They passed ; I heard no more till both were brought<lb/>
round again.<lb/>
‘It is nothing. What is the prick of a pin, in the bewilder-<lb/>
ment of the waltz, at the moment when your destiny is about<lb/>
to be accomplished ?	,<lb/>
“ The music played more briskly ; the dancers moved more<lb/>
rapidly. As they passed again, I heard the mask say—<lb/>
‘What have you done with the young man who loved you<lb/>
so much—with Gustave ’<lb/>
'Heavens ! the pin hurts me severely ! Stop—let us stop<lb/>
—for mercy’s sake!’	<lb/>
“ But he bore her on, more impetuously than ever.<lb/>
‘He loved you passionately—with so much faith—so<lb/>
much devotion! What have you done with him ?’<lb/>
'This pricking—oh ! what pain! what pain !'<lb/>
“Again they passed,—I sought them eagerly: but had<lb/>
hardly caught a glimpse of them, than a bound brought them<lb/>
near me. I heard the wild voice of the mask !<lb/>
'You enticed him into crime—into infamy! In exchange<lb/>
for his love, you gave him—the galleys!<lb/>
   'For mercy's sake, Monsieur! I am dying with pain!<lb/>
The pricking is more severe than ever!'<lb/>
'To save yourself'—cried he, 'you, who devised the crime<lb/>
—you, who reaped its sole fruits—betrayed and sold him!<lb/>
You abandoned him to death, without compassion.'<lb/>

'Heap your reproaches upon me ; I merit them. But for<lb/>
pity’s sake, monsieur, let me rest. This frightful pain—I<lb/>
can support it no longer.’<lb/>
“ He grasped her as a tiger would seize his prey.<lb/>
‘Waltz on—you shall not stop !’ he cried. They whirled<lb/>
again round the circle.<lb/>
'	I will cry for help—help ! Oh ! my heart! the pain is<lb/>
in my heart!’<lb/>
“I felt the locks of Giuseppa brush against my cheek.<lb/>
The mask laughed scornfully.<lb/>
'Cry out! the music will drown your voice.’<lb/>
‘Help! help!’ cried she, struggling.<lb/>
“ During this strange scene I stood motionless and appalled.<lb/>
I could hear the voice of her tormentor more terrible than<lb/>
ever.<lb/>
‘ Cry out again, and you die instantly ! This pricking is<lb/>
from the point of my stiletto; it has slowly pierced your<lb/>
breast.’<lb/>
‘ Help me!’<lb/>
“ I rushed towards them. The ma,sk cried in her ear, ‘ It<lb/>
is the hand of Gustave that holds the steel.’<lb/>
‘ Great heaven ! aid me !—aid !’<lb/>
‘ Hold ! would you perish ? Before any one comes to help<lb/>
you I will plunge it in your heart!’<lb/>
'In spite of my efforts, I could not keep up with them. I<lb/>
heard no more, but in every turn of the waltz I saw the face<lb/>
of Giuseppa—her eyes fixed with horror—her cheek growing<lb/>
paler and paler ; her livid lips striving to articulate. At last<lb/>
some crimson drops fell on her gauze dress. The inexorable<lb/>
mask clasped his victim more closely in his arms. The cre-<lb/>
scendo of the musicians announced that the waltz was at an<lb/>
end; when a cry of mortal anguish startled every one pre-<lb/>
sent. I rushed to the spot. Giuseppa had sunk to the ground;<lb/>
a fine stiletto had pierced her heart.<lb/>
“Search was instantly made for the murderer; the gates<lb/>
were closed, and no one permitted to go forth till alter a<lb/>
strict examination. But it was unsuccessful; all that could<lb/>
be found was a black domino, spotted with blood, and thrown<lb/>
in a corner of the vestibule.<lb/>
“I never heard afterwards of Remicourt; and placed the<lb/>
money he had left with me in the funds of one of the hospi-<lb/>
tals of Paris. No one has ever come to claim the watch, or<lb/>
mentioned the name engraved within it. Here it is”—said<lb/>
he, showing it to me.<lb/>

are waiting to consult with me. Adieu.” e. f. ellet.<lb/></ab></div>
<!--THE OVAL PORTRAIT.<lb/>
The chateau into which my valet had ventured to make<lb/>
forcible entrance, rather than permit me, in my desperately<lb/>
wounded condition, to pass a night in the open air, was one<lb/>
of those piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which<lb/>
have so long frowned among the Appenines, not less in fact<lb/>
than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe. To all appearance it<lb/>
had been temporarily and very lately abandoned. We estab-<lb/>
lished ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuous-<lb/>
ly furnished apartments. It lay in a remote turret of the<lb/>
building. Its decorations were rich, yet tattered and antique.<lb/>
Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with mani-<lb/>
fold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an unu-<lb/>
sually great number of very spirited modern paintings in<lb/>
frames of rich golden arabesque. In these paintings, which<lb/>
depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces, but<lb/>
in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the<lb/>
chateau rendered necessary—in these paintings my incipient<lb/>
delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so<lb/>
that I bade Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room—<lb/>
since it was already night—to light the longues of a tall<lb/>
candelabrum which stood by the head of my bed—and to<lb/>
throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black velvet<lb/>
which enveloped the bed itself. I wished all this done that<lb/>
I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to<lb/>
the contemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a<lb/>
small volume which had been found upon the pillow, and<lb/>
which purported to criticise and describe them.<lb/>
Long—long I read—and devoutly, devotedly I gazed.<lb/>
Rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by, and the deep mid-<lb/>
night came. The position of the candelabrum displeased<lb/>
me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty, rather than<lb/>
disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its<lb/>
rays more fully upon the book.<lb/>
But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated.<lb/>
The rays of the numerous candles (for there were many)<lb/>
now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto<lb/>
been thrown into deep shade by one of the bed-posts.	I<lb/>
thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. It<lb/>
was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into woman-<lb/>
hood. I glanced at the painting hurriedly, and then closed<lb/>
my eyes. Why I did this was not at first apparent even to<lb/>
my own perception. But while my lids remained thus shut,<lb/>
I ran over in mind my reason for so shutting them. It was<lb/>
an impulsive movement to gain time for thought—to make<lb/>
sure that my vision had not deceived me—to calm and sub-<lb/>
due my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze. In a<lb/>
very few moments I again looked fixedly at the painting.<lb/>
That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt;<lb/>
for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had<lb/>
seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing<lb/>
over my senses, and to startle me at once into waking life.<lb/>
The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young<lb/>
girl. It was a mere head and shoulders, done in what is<lb/>
technically termed a vignette manner; much in the style of<lb/>
the favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the bosom and even<lb/>
the ends of the radiant hair, melted imperceptibly into the<lb/>
vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of<lb/>
the whole. The frame was oval, richly gilded and filagreed<lb/>
in Moresque. As a thing of art nothing could be more ad-<lb/>
mirable than the painting itself. But it could have been<lb/>
neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty<lb/>
of the countenance, which bad so suddenly and so vehement-<lb/>
ly moved me. Least of all, could it have been that my fan-<lb/>
cy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the head for<lb/>
that of a living person. I saw at once that the peculiarities<lb/>
of the design, of the vignetting, and of the frame, must have<lb/>
instantly dispelled such idea—must have prevented even its<lb/>
momentary entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon these<lb/>
points, I remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half re-<lb/>
clining, with my vision riveted upon the portrait. At length,<lb/>
satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I fell back with-<lb/>
in the bed. I had found the spell of the picture in an absolute<lb/>
life-likeliness of expression, which at first startling, finally<lb/>
confounded, subdued and appalled me. With deep and rev-<lb/>
erent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position.<lb/>
The cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view,<lb/>
I sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings<lb/>
and their histories. Turning to the number which designat-<lb/>
ed the oval portrait, I there read the vague and quaint words<lb/>
which follow:<lb/>
“ She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely<lb/>
than full of glee. And evil was the hour when she saw, and<lb/>
loved, and wedded the painter. He, passionate, studious,<lb/>
austere, and having already a bride in his Art: she a maiden<lb/>
of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee: all<lb/>
light and smiles, and frolicksome as the young fawn : loving<lb/>
and cherishing all things : hating only the Art which was<lb/>
her rival: dreading only the pallet and brushes and other<lb/>
untoward instruments which deprived her of the counte-<lb/>
nance of her lover. It was thus a terrible thing for this lady<lb/>
to hear the painter speak of his desire to pourtray even his<lb/>
young bride. But she was humble and obedient, and sat<lb/>
meekly for many weeks in the dark high turret-chamber<lb/>
where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from over-<lb/>
head. But he, the painter, look glory in his work, which<lb/>
went on from hour to hour and from day to day. And he<lb/>
was a passionate, and wild and moody man, who became<lb/>
lost in reveries ; so that he would not see that the light which<lb/>
fell so ghastlily in that lone turret withered the health and<lb/>
the spirits of his bride, who pined visibly to all but him.<lb/>
Yet she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she<lb/>
saw that the painter, (who had high renown,) took a fervid<lb/>
and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and night<lb/>
to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more<lb/>
dispirited and weak. And in sooth some who beheld tbe<lb/>
portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty<lb/>
marvel, and a proof not less of the power of the painter than<lb/>
of his deep love for her whom he depicted so surpassingly<lb/>
well. But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its conclu-<lb/>
sion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the pain-<lb/>
ter had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned<lb/>
his eyes from the canvas rarely, even to regard the counte-<lb/>
nance of his wife. And he would not see that the tints<lb/>
which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the<lb/>
cheeks of her who sate beside him. And when many weeks<lb/>
THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.<lb/>
265<pb n="265"/><lb/>
had passed, and hut little remained to do, save one brush up-<lb/>
on the mouth and one tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady<lb/>
again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp.<lb/>
And then the brush was given, and then the tint was plac-<lb/>
ed ; and, for one moment, the painter stood entranced before<lb/>
the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while he<lb/>
yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast,<lb/>
and crying with a loud voice ‘This is indeed Life itself!’<lb/>
turned suddenly to regard his beloved:—She was dead."<lb/>

THE DIGNITY OF LABOR.<lb/>
This is one of the cant phrases of the day, but it is used<lb/>
mainly by people who prefer to be undignified and idle.<lb/>
The dignity of labor is a good phrase by itself, but we have<lb/>
never heard it used by cartmen or hod-carriers, or kitchen<lb/>
maids; neither have we known any body able to live in idle-<lb/>
ness, voluntarily going to work for the sake of the dignity at-<lb/>
tending upon useful employment. The most ambitious men<lb/>
among us are covetous of the indignities of do-nothing-hood.<lb/>
We hear every day people talk with great sincerity of the<lb/>
dignity of labor, but yet nobody manifests any desire to gain<lb/>
distinction by carrying a hod or trundling a porter’s barrow.<lb/>
On the contrary, our ambitious men are not only very care-<lb/>
ful to do nothing that is useful themselves, but they even es-<lb/>
teem it an honor to be descended from ancestors who have<lb/>
never labored. We know the son of a house carpenter who<lb/>
blushes like scarlet whenever his father’s profession is allu-<lb/>
ded to, while another gentleman of our acquaintance who<lb/>
has been compelled to labor at a trade biinself, takes great<lb/>
delight in boasting of his grandfather, who had never labor-<lb/>
ed at any useful occupation in his life, but had lived on a<lb/>
pension from government, which was awarded to him in<lb/>
consideration of his having worn a pair of gilt epaulettes a<lb/>
certain number of years. The dignity of labor, is a phrase<lb/>
that was invented by certain people who wished to make<lb/>
laborers contented with their condition, lest they should grow<lb/>
dissatisfied and refuse to work any longer to support a cer-<lb/>
tain number of their fellow beings in a state of idlehood;<lb/>
but the laborers do not appear to appreciate the compliment<lb/>
that has been so generously bestowed upon them, and as they<lb/>
seem as little satisfied with their condition as ever, we would<lb/>
throw out a hint to the philanthropists to bestow the titles<lb/>
of honor which are now exclusively conferred upon idlers,<lb/>
upon the laborers, and perhaps by this expedient those who<lb/>
earn our daily bread for us might be induced to believe that<lb/>
there is a real dignity in labor. In the event of a reversal of<lb/>
titles taking place, those who labor the hardest should re-<lb/>
ceive the highest honors. A gentleman farmer, or a boss<lb/>
builder, would then call his ploughman or hod-carrier, your<lb/>
excellency Andrew Maguire, while a member of Congress<lb/>
would call his man Charles, “your honor,” and a rich brok-<lb/>
er would address his coachman as Dennis O’Neal, Esq. A<lb/>
boss workman or an overseer would, of course, be nothing<lb/>
more than plain mister. A merchant’s wife would call her<lb/>
chambermaids young ladies, and her cook madame. A sys-<lb/>
tem like this would be very likely to have an extremely hap-<lb/>
py effect upon the lower classes, and convince them that the<lb/>
dignity of labor is not a mere hollow sound uttered by<lb/>
quack philanthropists to please the ear of mountebank mor-<lb/>
alists. As it is not unlikely that our hint will be taken by<lb/>
the upper classes, who are fond of anything that smacks of<lb/>
novelty, we will give a model or two lor the kind of recom-<lb/>
mendation that should in such a case be given to a servant on<lb/>
leaving his place.<lb/>

REVIEWS.<lb/>
Thirteenth Annual Report of the Trustees of the Perkins Institution<lb/>
and Massachusetts Asylum of the Blind.<lb/>
This exceedingly interesting report is from the pen of the<lb/>
philanthropic Director of the Asylum at Mount Washington,<lb/>
Dr. Howe. It is not simply a report of the condition of the<lb/>
Institution, for it contains much collateral matter full of im-<lb/>
portant suggestions to thinking minds. But the chief interest<lb/>
of the report centres in that part of it which relates to Laura<lb/>
Bridgman, the deaf and blind mute, whose deprivations<lb/>
have rendered her name famous. It is generally known that<lb/>
Dr. Howe had succeeded in opening a communication of<lb/>
ideas with her, seemingly an almost impossible attempt, and<lb/>
that under his care she was gradually coming to a knowledge<lb/>
of the kind of world, physical and spiritual, which she inha-<lb/>
bits. The great difficulty in the education of a mind like<lb/>
hers, must be to keep it free from errors, for all abstract<lb/>
truths and falsities must be alike to her, and an impression<lb/>
once created upon her mind could scarcely be removed.<lb/>
Feeling the importance of this, her instructor was very care-<lb/>
ful not to allow any improper person to have communication<lb/>
with her; but during his absence in Europe last year, it ap-<lb/>
years that some busy-body, more zealous than discreet, un-<lb/>
dertook to indoctrinate the poor girl with sectarian princi-<lb/>
ples, and sadly deranged her ideas of the Deity by talking to<lb/>
her of the Atonement, the Lamb of God, and some mystical<lb/>
points of mere speculative doctrine. These things were, per-<lb/>
haps, not further beyond her comprehension than of the per-<lb/>
sons who talked to her about them ; but they perplexed her<lb/>
more, because she required for every symbol a definite idea.<lb/>
She could not understand metaphorical language; hence the<lb/>
Lamb of God was to her a real animal, and she could not<lb/>
conceive why it did not grow old like other lambs, and be<lb/>
called a sheep. Her misconception of terms which, from<lb/>
their familiarity, are to us so plain in their meaning, shows<lb/>
how difficult the task must be always to convey exact<lb/>
thoughts to her mind on abstract subjects. She appears to<lb/>
be very much attached to Dr. Howe, and while he was in<lb/>
Europe sent him several letters, one of which we extract<lb/>
from the Report:—<lb/>
MY VERY DEAR Dr. Howe :<lb/>
What can I first say to God when I am wrong? Would he send<lb/>
me good thoughts and forgive me when I am very sad for doing<lb/>
wrong ? Why does he not love wrong people if they love him ?<lb/>
Would he be very happy to have me think of Him and Heaven very<lb/>
often? Do you remember that you said I must think of God and Hea-<lb/>
ven ? I want you to please to answer me to please me. I have learn-<lb/>
ed about a great many things to please you very much. Mrs. Har-<lb/>
rington has got a new little baby eight days last Saturday. God was<lb/>
very generous and kind to give babies to many people. Miss Roger’s<lb/>
mother has got baby two months ago. I want to see you very much.<lb/>
I send much love to you. Is God ever ashamed? I think of God very<lb/>
often to love Him. Why did you say that I must think of God ? You<lb/>
must answer me all about it, if you do not I shall be sad. Shall we<lb/>
know what to ask God to do ? When will he let us go to see Him in<lb/>
Heaven ! How did God tell people that he lived in Heaven ? How<lb/>
could he take care of folks in Heaven and why is he our Father?<lb/>
When can he let us go in Heaven ? Why can not He let wrong peo-<lb/>
ple to go to live with Him and be happy ? Why should he not like to<lb/>
have us ask him to send us good thoughts if we are not very sad for<lb/>
doing wrong.<lb/>
The whole Report relating to this interesting girl is in-<lb/>
tensely exciting, and we shall look forward to the annual<lb/>
reports of Doctor Howe with a good deal of curiosity. She<lb/>
could hardly have fallen into better hands for her own hap-<lb/>
piness, or for the benefit of mankind. It is very apparent<lb/>
that important hints in education may be gathered in watch-<lb/>
ing the advancement of a mind like Laura Bridgman’s from<lb/>
total darkness into the light of comparative day. Although<lb/>
now on the verge of womanhood, she has less elementary<lb/>
knowledge than a child of six years.<lb/>

The Diary of Lady Willoughby. No. 5 of Wiley & Putnam’s Library<lb/>
of Choice Reading, pp. 100. Price 25 cents.<lb/>
The Diary of Lady Willoughby is framed on the exact plan<lb/>
of the Amber Witch, and is quite as successful a composition<lb/>
in its way, although it is entirely unlike that remarkable<lb/>
production.<lb/>
It professes to be the diary of an English lady, in the lat-<lb/>
ter part of the reign of Charles I, during the first fourteen<lb/>
years of her married life. To make the resemblance to reality<lb/>
the more perfect, the first edition in England was published<lb/>
in exact imitation of books in the seventeenth century. This<lb/>
external evidence of authenticity must have helped, in a de-<lb/>
gree, to render more perfect the illusion which the author has<lb/>
created, and it is not strange that many, even among learned<lb/>
readers, believed it to be a genuine diary of the troublous times<lb/>
of the English revolution. As a literary curiosity it could<lb/>
have but little value for the million, but as a truthful record<lb/>
of human affections, which are the same in all time, it will<lb/>
have a value, like that of those simple tales which are al-<lb/>
ways so acceptable to the great mass of English readers. A<lb/>
lady of our acquaintance, who is no great devourer of books,<lb/>
by the way, took it up by accident, and declared that she had<lb/>
never been so bewitched by a book before. It is evidently<lb/>
the work of a pious, tender-hearted mother—such a passage<lb/>
as the following could have been written by none other:<lb/>
“ Arose this morning with mind more composed than for some time<lb/>
past. Cicely’s mother ill, and I went down to see her: She is a bright<lb/>
Example of Patience ; her Trials and Sufferings have been manifold,<lb/>
bodily pain the least, has lost three children in infancy, and one<lb/>
daughter grown up: and yet, can it be, has known still deeper sorrow.<lb/>
Returned through the Park. Never saw the chestnuts and beeches<lb/>
more beautiful in their autumnal tints, the fallen leaves crushed pleas-<lb/>
antly beneath my feet; the Sun was setting before I was aware, and<lb/>
the Aire grew suddenly chill. Taking the nearest way I entered the<lb/>
house by aside door, and there beneath the old Mulberry saw the lit-<lb/>
tle Carte and whip as they had been left by my poor Child the last<lb/>
day he was out, when he looked so tired and I carried him in. I<lb/>
stooped and look up the Whip, and hiding it beneath my cloke, went<lb/>
straight up stairs: no Hand had touched it since his : the teares I wept<lb/>
over it did me good: it seemed my innocent right to weep over this<lb/>
Token of my lost one.<lb/>
“ The fullnesse and brightnesse of a young mother can never againe<lb/>
be my experience, since that joy has been a Source of Suffering and<lb/>
agony never to be forgotten. Death followed into the habitation<lb/>
where life had just taken his abode. Not in short space of time can<lb/>
the Heart recover such Dispensations, and in the excellency of no other<lb/>
joys can it ever forget the stroke that first destroyed its sweetest hopes:<lb/>
Death once seene at our Hearth leaveth a shadow which abideth there<lb/>
forever.”<lb/>
History of Germany, from the earliest period to the present time.<lb/>
By Frederic Kohlrausch. Translated from the last German edition<lb/>
by James D. Haas. Part 1,25 cents. D. Appleton & Co., 200 Broad-<lb/>

It is surprising that a work of such great importance and<lb/>
permanent popularity should have remained so long untrans-<lb/>
lated into the English language, as the history of Germany<lb/>
by Kohlrausch. A work of the kind for popular reading has<lb/>
long been wanted, and the Appletons have done the public a<lb/>
service by commencing its publication in their valuable series<lb/>
of historical works. ______________<lb/>

Form Nos. 1 and 2 of a new Library of Standard Novels,<lb/>
the publication of which has just been begun by Henry G.<lb/>
Daggers, 30 Ann street, on the cheap system; in respect of<lb/>
which the editor, Mr. Benjamin, very justly remarks, in the<lb/>
prospectus: “There is certainly no reason in the nature of<lb/>
things why a novel should be more harmless when printed<lb/>
in a costly and elegant style, than when issued so as to<lb/>
render it obtainable by the poor as well as the rich, by the<lb/>
laboring as well as the idle. Nevertheless there may be, and<lb/>
doubtless is, some force in the objections to cheap literature,<lb/>
based on the fact that the system has been abused. This,<lb/>
however, should not cause any reader to reject, but simply to<lb/>
discriminate. Before purchasing, even at the most paltry<lb/>
prices, he should look at the name of the editor or publisher,<lb/>
and, if either be a man of fair standing, give him the benefit<lb/>
of it; his goods should be considered with as much discrimi-<lb/>
nation as those of a manufacturer, and his stamp should<lb/>
pass as current with the public.”<lb/>
It is greatly to be deplored that publishers are too seldom<lb/>
influenced by any other motives in putting forth books, than<lb/>
mercenary considerations, but books should not be regarded as<lb/>
mere merchandise, and no publisher should allow his name to<lb/>
appear on a book of pernicious tendencies, who wishes to pre-<lb/>
serve the character of a good citizen, or establish himself in a<lb/>
profitable business. The most successful publishers of cheap<lb/>
books, are the Chambers, of Edinburgh, who have never, in<lb/>
any instance pandered to the base feelings of our nature, by<lb/>
the issue of improper books, or sought to gain popularity by<lb/>
any species of trickery or meretricious show. Their eminent<lb/>
success should embolden other publishers to imitate their<lb/>
example.<lb/>
The books which Mr. Daggers has selected for the initials<lb/>
of his series are unexceptionable of their kind, and they are of<lb/>
a kind which will always be popular while there is a love tor<lb/>
the marvelous in the human mind.<lb/>
Principles of Forensic Medicine. By William A Guy, M. B., Cantab.,<lb/>
Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, etc., etc. First Ameri-<lb/>
can edition. With Notes and Additions, by Charles A. Lee, M. D.,<lb/>
Professor of Materia Medica and General Pathology in Geneva<lb/>
College, etc., etc. New York : Harper & Brothers.<lb/>
We believe that before the publication of Dr. Guy's book,<lb/>
there was no convenient text-book of the English language<lb/>
on the subject of Forensic Medicine. The voluminous work<lb/>
of the Becks, although highly elaborate and meritorious was<lb/>
for obvious reasons unadapted to the purposes of the student<lb/>
—nor, indeed, as a manual for the legal or medical practi-<lb/>
tioner, could it be considered as suitable in any respect. The<lb/>
present volume omits every thing of merely literary interest<lb/>
as well as all that concerns the history of Forensic Medicine’<lb/>
—that is to say, the state of the law in former times and in<lb/>
different countries. The mam object has been to afford re-<lb/>
sults—general conclusions—in a word, to make a practical<lb/>
and useful book.<lb/>
In discussing each subject, the author commences with a<lb/>
brief account of the existing provisions of the law ; investiga-<lb/>
ting, in the second place, under distinct heads, the principal<lb/>
medical questions springing from the law, and appending<lb/>
practical rules for medico-legal investigation. Throughout<lb/>
the subjects are illustrated by cases.<lb/>
The American editor has corrected numerous errors existing<lb/>
in the English work, and adapted the whole to the laws and<lb/>
institutions of the United States. His additions (which are<lb/>
very numerous and important) are distinguished from the<lb/>
English text by being enclosed in brackets.<lb/>

The first consideration forcing itself on the mind while<lb/>
looking over such a volume as this, is, what might have<lb/>
been thought, before the invention of printing, of the pro-<lb/>
position to sell this amount of reading matter for fifty cents.<lb/>
Here are 700 pages, printed in close minion type, profuse-<lb/>
ly interspersed with nonpareil, in double columns large oc-<lb/>

would be found scarcely more really marvellous than this.<lb/>

We observe that unusual care has been taken in getting<lb/>
up this edition. The typography is very correct, and the five<lb/>

The numerous testimonials to the merit of this volume<lb/>

the student of the German language. The manner of ar-<lb/>

The Chronicles of Pineville. By the author of Major Jones’<lb/>
Courtship, with twelve illustrations, engraved from original designs<lb/>
by F. O. C. Darley. Philadelphia. Carey and Hart. 1845.<lb/>
It is still a disputed point among certain critics whether<lb/>
America has produced a humorous writer, and we have<lb/>
heard the author of the book before us cited as the best ex-<lb/>
ample of a humorist that America can boast. But the Au-<lb/>
thor of Major Jones’ Courtship is a comic rather than a hu-<lb/>
morous writer. The merit of his sketches lies in their fidel-<lb/>
ity to the scenes described, and not in their wit and humor.<lb/>
The illustrations by Darley are the best of the kind that we<lb/>
have seen in any American work, they are executed with<lb/>
great freedom, and are very well as mere designs, but they<lb/>
lack character, as they could not fail to do, since they were<lb/>
not drawn from nature. They might be used to illustrate<lb/>
tales of Michigan or Massachusetts life with as much propri-<lb/>
ety as sketches of life in Georgia. In one of the illustrations<lb/>
there is a stone cottage, and in another there is a row of<lb/>
three story houses ; but we doubt the existence of such<lb/>
things in Pineville. The cuts are executed with greater<lb/>
neatness and beauty than we are accustomed to see in our<lb/>
wood engravings, and they are exceedingly well printed.<lb/>
THE MAGAZINES.<lb/>
The Lady’s Book for May has several very excellent papers—<lb/>
among which the most valuable if not altogether the most interesting<lb/>
is the “ European Correspondence” by Grund. Mr. Grund is one of<lb/>
the most remarkable men we ever met,—possessing a wonderful facul-<lb/>
ty of observation, and a memory which stands in little need of Profes-<lb/>
sor Gouraud. His analytical power is also great, and as a critic few<lb/>
men are entitled to greater consideration. Take as a specimen his<lb/>
account of Kaulbach’s “Destruction of Jerusalem.”<lb/>
"Kaulbach, in his ‘ Destruction of Jerusalem,’ seizes not only on<lb/>
an historical moment or catastrophe in the downfall of the Jews, but<lb/>
on its poetical signification and its connection and relation to the hu-<lb/>
man mind, which, after all, is the great laboratory of history. The<lb/>
most accurate description of an event by an eye-witness is yet tar<lb/>
from being an herodical account of the same, and so is the representa-<lb/>
tion of an historical event far from being an historical picture. Kaul-<lb/>
bach shows us the awful calamity of the destruction of the holy city<lb/>
in its historical signification, in its relation to our religious conscious-<lb/>
ness and to ourselves. The figures which he presents to the eye of<lb/>
the beholder were never in life thus grouped together, and yet—his<lb/>
painting is eminently historical.<lb/>
“ In the middle of the picture you see a group of dead bodies, dying<lb/>
men and women, and some who, in their despair, attempt to destroy<lb/>
themselves. This is the high priest, with his family; on both sides<lb/>
and behind him you behold the cause of their distraction—the sources<lb/>
of these rivers of blood. The Roman imperator enters in triumph the<lb/>
holy city: the horrors of heathenism are planted on the altar of the<lb/>
only living God ; the daughters of Zion are robbed : mothers, in des-<lb/>
pair, attack their own flesh and blood ; and the people, in wild dis-<lb/>
may, throng the streets leading to the temple of Jehovah, whose<lb/>
burning columns threaten to bury them under its burning ruins. But<lb/>
the painter, in producing this wild confusion, has introduced the unity<lb/>
of design by the higher religious source from which these evils spring.<lb/>
The religious faith of the world saw in the destruction of Jerusalem a<lb/>
visitation of Divine Providence, which was expected as it was prophe-<lb/>
sied. This idea is introduced into the picture by the angels with<lb/>
burning swords which descend from Heaven, and the holy prophets<lb/>
which are there enthroned. The destruction of the holy city, there-<lb/>
fore, is an act of poetic justice—the last act of the Jewish drama<lb/>
which reconciles the beholder to her fate. But. also, the relation of<lb/>
the catastrophe to our own times is admirably indicated. It deprived<lb/>
the people of Israel of their home : what remained of their faith was<lb/>
doomed to endure the yoke of perpetual slavery. This fact the mid-<lb/>
dle ages have dressed into the Story of ‘ The Wandering Jew;’ and<lb/>
him, scourged by demons, the artist has introduced into his picture.<lb/>
But what of the people of Israel belongs to the New Testament, des-<lb/>
tined in the name of the Saviour to possess the world, our Christian<lb/>
ancestors leave, under the guidance of angels, the burning town. This<lb/>
group concludes the picture.<lb/>
“ The design is, us you may conclude from this description, con-<lb/>
ceived in the most elevated and philosophical sense. It is, as regards<lb/>
that conception, unique and unsurpassed by any work of art, ancient<lb/>
or modern. The whole is. as it were, a picture in motion.”<lb/>
Miss Leslie continues her “ Bloxhams and Mayfields,” which loses<lb/>
nothing of its interest as it proceeds. “La Cubana,” by the Poor<lb/>
Scholar, has some passages of glowing poetry, intermingled with<lb/>
some that are any thing else. “ The Gazelle ot the Menagerie,” by<lb/>
Miss Gould is particularly happy, and so is the “ Horae Otiosae.”<lb/>
The engravings are a mezzotint by Sadd, (Charles I. taking leave of<lb/>
his children,) and a Mountish-looking design entitled “ The Recruit”<lb/>
—engraved by Ellis.<lb/>
In the “Editors’ Book Table” there are some very just remarks on<lb/>
the subject of taking out copyright for Magazines. It is really very<lb/>
difficult to see how any one can, in conscience, object to such a course<lb/>
on the part of Mess. Godey and Graham. To our apprehension a mere<lb/>
statement of the facts of the case should stand in lieu of all argument.<lb/>
It has been long the custom among the newspapers—the weeklies es-<lb/>
pecially—to copy Magazine articles in full, and circulate them all over<lb/>
the country—sometimes in advance of the magazines themselves. In<lb/>
other words Godey and Graham have been at all the cost, while the<lb/>
papers have enjoyed, if not all the advantage—at least the most im-<lb/>
portant item of it—the origination of the articles. To such au extent<lb/>
had this piracy been carried, that many magaziue subscribers ceased<lb/>
to be euch, because they could procure all that was valuable in<lb/>
these works from the newspapers very little later and often at less<lb/>
cost, than from the magazines themselves.<lb/>
Graham’s Magazine for May is peculiarly rich in contributions.<lb/>
Cooper’s sketch of Preble is worthy the best days of its author. Mrs.<lb/>
Stephens’ “ Zuleica” is, also, an excellent article, and Grund's ‘ ‘ For-<lb/>
eign Literary News” will be read with interest by all:—it is sadly dis-<lb/>
figured, however, by typographical mistakes. We venture to correct<lb/>
one or two of these, in copying the annexed exquisite ballad. It is<lb/>
quoted by Mr. Grund from “ La Normandie Romanesque, Traditions,<lb/>
Legendes et Superstitions Populaires de Cette Province.”<lb/>

Besides the articles above noticed, there are papers from Headley,<lb/>
Whipple, Fanny Forrester, Mrs. Seba Smith, Tuckerman, Lowell,<lb/>
Mrs. Caroline Butler, and others.<lb/>
In Mr. Lowell’s poem, “ An Incident of the Fire at Hamburgh,”<lb/>
there are some very noble images. For example :<lb/>
Not Nature's self more freely speaks In crystal or in oak,<lb/>
Than through the pious builder’s hand in that gray pile she spoke;<lb/>
And as from acorn springs the oak, so, freely and alone,<lb/>
Sprang from his heart this hymn to God, sung in obedient stone.<lb/>

Mrs. Ellet, John Brougham, Miss Browne, Arthur. Miss Brawner, E.<lb/>

Mrs. Osgood’s “ Golden Rules in Rhyme.” We fancy, however, that<lb/>

literary interest, which we shall notice more fully hereafter.<lb/>
In the review of the “ Spirit of the Age,” although “ Orion” is hear-<lb/>

THE CONCERT ROOM.<lb/>
CONCERT OF THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY.<lb/>

the Apollo Saloon on Saturday April 19th. The following is the pro-<lb/>
gramme :<lb/>

Overture, (Oberon.) -	Weber.<lb/>
The symphony by Beethoven is a wonderful composition. The<lb/>
programme states that the subject is, or may be, supposed to be the<lb/>
story of Orpheus and Eurydice ; whether such is the case or not, we<lb/>
will not argue at present. Indeed, unless the composer himself states<lb/>
his subject, we should, ourselves, always receive, with much caution,<lb/>
any gratuitous elucidation, for music will so differently affect different<lb/>
people, that what will appear perfectly natural, and in just accordance<lb/>
with the refined feelings of some, would seem sheer raving and mad-<lb/>
ness to others. It is true, that intellectual musical minds will but<lb/>
rarely differ upon the true sentiment and meaning of a fine composi-<lb/>
tion ; but as to its detail, no two will be found to agree, unless indeed<lb/>
the composition be vocal.<lb/>
The performance of the first movement was slovenly in the extreme<lb/>
It wanted precision, force, and clearness. We would merely quote<lb/>
the mistake made by Mr. J. A. Kyle, to prove that even such orches-<lb/>
tral excellence may have an exception. We would suggest to the con-<lb/>
ductor, if one who follows where be should lead may be called so.<lb/>
that when he meets with a p in his score, that its meaning is piano or<lb/>
soft, and that two pp’s mean also soft, only more so. This will cer-<lb/>
tainly be no news to him theoretically, but it would certainly astonish<lb/>
his hearers, if he should by chanct give any practical evidence of his<lb/>
knowledge. The Andante is truly an exquisite movement, but it was<lb/>
badly played; there was a total want of delicacy in the performance<lb/>
of the stringed instruments, (excepting the violoncelli, which were ad-<lb/>
mirably handled) the violins scraped away unmercifully without taste<lb/>
or expression, and in the short fugue towards the close, one half<lb/>
seemed undetermined whether they were playing in the major or the<lb/>
minor.<lb/>
The Allegretto or minuett and trio, was begun one half too fast so<lb/>
the conductor immediately altered the time, and continued altering it<lb/>
backward and forward, until he suited himself, which did not happen<lb/>
we conclude, until after the movement finished.<lb/>
We would gladly expatiate upon the beauty and the peculiarity of<lb/>
this movement, but we have a long notice before us and must refrain.<lb/>
For a description of the finale, we must refer our readers to the<lb/>
printed description—it says that “ it will be found in many parts, the<lb/>
very embodiment of mental distraction.” Gentle reader, this is per-<lb/>
fectly true ; a more perfect picture—tone-picture—of mental distrac-<lb/>
tion, we never listened to, but the author had less to do with it than<lb/>
the conductor and the band. It was chaos, chaos—nothing but chaos !<lb/>
It was a performance utterly disgraceful to a society of such preten-<lb/>
sions, and one formed of such admirable materials. But the cause of<lb/>
this is by no means difficult to arrive at. The society is made up of<lb/>
cliques or cabals, composed of different nations; some of these parties<lb/>
are a compound of two people of different birth places, who coalesce<lb/>
for the purpose of keeping a third party from taking the lead; and it,<lb/>
unfortunately, most frequently happens that the most worthy and effi-<lb/>
cient member is sacrificed to a mean, paltry, narrow-minded, national<lb/>
and party jealousy or prejudice, while in his stead is placed a man in-<lb/>
capable of filling the office with any credit to himself or the society.<lb/>
Not only does this illiberal feeling exist and act within the society it-<lb/>
self, but it operates to the exclusion of good, efficient, and necessary<lb/>
members; so jealous is each party, lest the new member should in-<lb/>
crease the number of its antagonists. We have repeatedly urged upon<lb/>
the society the necessity of increasing its force in violins; and every<lb/>
member who knows anything, will accede to the justice of the remark;<lb/>
and yet we know of at least one case, where an excellent violin player,<lb/>
firm, powerful and talented, was proposed, but black-balled by the<lb/>
party in power, for no other possible reason than that he was not of<lb/>
their party. This is a state of things which cannot but prove fatal to<lb/>
the very existence of the society, it persisted in.<lb/>
The fatal effects of its operation is plainly to be traced in the evident<lb/>
deterioration of the performances. The members arc the same; we<lb/>
must conclude that they have not lost any of their mechanical ability !<lb/>
How then can we account for this deterioration, otherwise than in the<lb/>
operation of these powerful cliques, which has resulted in the frequent<lb/>
election of a conductor whom we distinctly assert to be incompetent<lb/>
to the office. We cannot believe that after exposing himself to the<lb/>
smiles of every musician present at the Philharmonic Concert on Sa-<lb/>
turday last, we cannot believe, we say, that Mr. U. C. Hill will ever<lb/>
attempt to wield the conductor’s baton in that society again ; or if he<lb/>
would, we cannot believe that he will ever be permitted so to do. We<lb/>
do not believe the professional experience of any individual member,<lb/>
can furnish a parallel to such misleadings, and if the party feelings of<lb/>
the members have not blinded them to the certain fatal results of their<lb/>
conduct, we may yet hope to see a beneficial change.<lb/>
Madame Otto sang two songs, one German and the other Italian.<lb/>
The remarks we have made upon this lady’s pronunciation of the En-<lb/>
glish language, will apply with double force to her Italian singing. It<lb/>
would be difficult, indeed, from the pronunciation, to fix upon any par.<lb/>
ticular language as the one in which she sung. Madame Otto is fool-<lb/>
ishly advised in the selection of her music. The songs she sings<lb/>
are generally beyond her power of execution ; requiring many qualifi.<lb/>
cations which she does not possess—thorough musical education, feel-<lb/>
ing, taste, and flexibility of voice.<lb/>
We have at least done some good by our remarks on these Concerts<lb/>
The method of accompanying the vocal music which we have so un-<lb/>
sparingly condemned, has given place to a more careful execution. In<lb/>
this Madame Otto hud an advantage never before afforded a singer at<lb/>
these concerts.<lb/>
Hummel’s piano-forte piece was the gem of the evening. It cannot<lb/>
be called strictly a piano piece, as no effect could be given to it with-<lb/>
out the assistance of the orchestra. It is descriptive of the wander,<lb/>
ings of the French knight Sir Huon, as described in the fairy tale of<lb/>
Oberon or the Charmed Horn. It is replete with beauties, and is pro-<lb/>
bably one of the most happily conceived descriptive pieces ever put<lb/>
u a paper. The Tempesta di Mare (Sea Storm) becomes truly sub-<lb/>
lime in its vraisemblance; the last movement, however, delighted us<lb/>
the most. Its theme is the Indian air introduced by Weber into his<lb/>
opera of Oberon. The ingenuity with which this is worked out in a<lb/>
thousand different ways, while brilliantly accompanied on the piano<lb/>

is worthy particular notice. The orchestral arrangements are exqui-<lb/>
site in their effects from the beginning to the end.<lb/>
Mr. Timm’s performance was distinguished by a fine appreciation<lb/>
of his author, discriminating taste, delicacy, precision and exquisite<lb/>
finish. We always feel a pure and unalloyed enjoyment in listening to<lb/>
this gentleman’s playing; we have certainly met many who can do<lb/>
more to astonish us, but Mr. Timm satisfies our judgment, and fills<lb/>
our mind with a perfect embodiment of the beautiful conceptions of<lb/>
the composer.<lb/>
Mendelssohn’s overture, Melusine, was performed for the first time<lb/>
in the country, but no justice was done to it. The countless delicate<lb/>
and beautiful points, the developement of which depend upon the in-<lb/>
ward perception of their importance by the conductor, were hidden,<lb/>
overlooked, or never known.<lb/>
The overture to Oberon was the best orchestral performance of the<lb/>
evening, but the effect was in a great measure marred by a want of<lb/>
power in the violins—they were altogether too weak. There was an<lb/>
error in the time of the first movement. We saw Weber conduct it,<lb/>
from the first rehearsal in the Saloon at Covent Garden Theatre, to<lb/>
the last rehearsal in the orchestra. He always made an accellerando<lb/>
after the eighth bar of the opening movement. This would suggest<lb/>
itself to any one studying it carefully, for otherwise the movement<lb/>
would be dragging in the extreme.<lb/>
With this overture concluded a concert very unsatisfactory in its re-<lb/>
sults, as a performance : the materials were good, but they were mar-<lb/>
red by incompetency and want of care.<lb/>
MUSICAL REVIEW.<lb/>
“ The Social Minstrel, designed for the use of the domestic circle,<lb/>
schools, concerts and classes, consisting of sacred and secular songs,<lb/>
duetts, trios, quartettes, rounds and chorusses; principally selected<lb/>
from the best European authors; arranged with an accompaniment<lb/>
for the piano forte, by David Paine.''<lb/>
Published by Crocker and Brewster, 47 Washington st. Boston.<lb/>
The taste for vocal music is spreading over the country most rapid-<lb/>
ly ; it is rooting itself firmly wherever four voices can be found to<lb/>
mingle in its practice. Vocal part-music is practiced in our cities to<lb/>
an extent scarcely to be believed by those who only know of music<lb/>
by attending the fashionable public concerts. There are many hun-<lb/>
dreds of young men, in New York alone, who, instead of wasting their<lb/>
time over the billiard table or dominoe box, meet together and devote<lb/>
two or three evenings every week to the study of glee singing, and re-<lb/>
ceive a rich reward in the delight experienced from the pleasant social<lb/>
intercourse and musical banquets which such meetings afford. No<lb/>
one will deny but that this promises well for the social and intellectu-<lb/>
al improvement of the people ; nor will any one deny that music may<lb/>
be made, by judicious fostering and enlightened encouragement, a pow-<lb/>
erful auxiliary in ameliorating the social wants in every circle of soci-<lb/>
ety.<lb/>
Music excited no inconsiderable attention among the ancients.<lb/>
They were fully impressed by the importance of the subject, not only<lb/>
as a branch of educational accomplishment, but as a moral force which<lb/>
might be wielded with powerful effect for the benefit of the people.<lb/>
Even as far back as Polybius, music was considered of the most vital<lb/>
importance in the education of youth, in all the ceremonies of state,<lb/>
and also in the religious rites of the church. Speaking of its power<lb/>
he says—“ Nor can it be supposed that the Lacedemonians and An-<lb/>
cient Cretans were not influenced by some good reason, when, in the<lb/>
place of trumpets, they introduced the sound of flutes and the har-<lb/>
mony of verse to animate their soldiers in the time of battle ; or that<lb/>
the first Arcadians acted without some strong necessity, who, though<lb/>
their lives and manners, in all other points, were rigid and austere, in-<lb/>
corporate this art into the very essence of their government; and obliged<lb/>
not their children only, but the young men likewise, till they had<lb/>
gained the age of thirty years, to persist in its constant study and<lb/>
practice." Most of the other ancient writers, spoke equally in its fa-<lb/>
vor, and recommended it upon every occasion.<lb/>
It is not strange, therefore, that we should hail with unfeigned plea-<lb/>
sure, the unmistakable evidence of the rapid growth of this delightful<lb/>
art in the affections of the people.<lb/>
If any other evidence were wanting to prove the correctness of our<lb/>
position, the mere fact of the publication of so many works devoted<lb/>
to vocal part-music, would be sufficient. Quite a number of Glee<lb/>
Books, re-published from English and German copies, have appeared<lb/>
in New York, and as far as we have seen, these are superior to any<lb/>
others published in the United Slates in respect to selection, form, and<lb/>
convenient arrangement. We allude particularly to the collection<lb/>
published by S. O. Dyer, 385 Hudson st., one volume of which has al-<lb/>
ready appeared, and another is in course of publication in monthly num-<lb/>
bers.<lb/>
The little book before us is simple and unpretending in its character,<lb/>
and contains many agreeable and pleasing pieces. They are, chiefly,<lb/>
selections from the best English writers, with some German and Ital-<lb/>
ian compositions. Among the composers we find the names of Doc-<lb/>
tors Arne, Callcott, Greene, and Hayes, J. Stafford Smith, Handel,<lb/>
Marcells, Neukomm, Rossini, Bellini, Barnett, Herold, Auber and<lb/>
Mendelssohn, with several others. Mr. Paine has contributed several<lb/>
of his own compositions, but anxious as we are to judge mildly, we<lb/>
must say that the collection would have been beautified if these had<lb/>
been omitted, they are so entirely common place and wanting in origi-<lb/>
nality. One very prominent defect in this work, is the constant occur-<lb/>
rence of false accentuation. In some places the words cannot be sung<lb/>
as written, without making positive nonsense. Take for instance the<lb/>
song—“ Woods in Winter,” in bars one and four, second line, p. 126,<lb/>
where the second syllable of the word upland, falls upon the accented<lb/>
beat of the bar, and the first syllabic of the word embracing, also up-<lb/>
on the accented beat. We could multiply these instances, almost<lb/>
without number, had we the space to spare. In arranging pieces Mr.<lb/>
Paine has taken too many liberties with his author; in the following<lb/>
pieces for instance ; When the moonlight streaming, Frendair, and the<lb/>
Hunters Signal Horn, by A. Lee, he has omitted entire the second<lb/>
part of the first, thus effectually divesting it of its meaning, and has<lb/>
omitted from the second, the concluding portions of the two first<lb/>
strains. This is altogether a needless curtailment, and is very bad<lb/>
taste. In the Widow’s Reply, composed by David Paine, in the fourth<lb/>
and fifth bars, page 73, the A flat in the accompaniment, should each<lb/>
time be sharps. Such errors betray a negligence truly reprehensible.<lb/>
The Book however really contains many valuable pieces of Music—<lb/>
some to suit all classes—the grave, the gay, the pious, and the senti-<lb/>
mental. It is bound in a neat cover, and is altogether got out in very<lb/>
excellent style.<lb/>
STODART & DUNHAM'S PIANO FORTES.<lb/>
We have spoken at length upon the manufacture of Piano Fortes,<lb/>
as exhibited at the factory of Messrs. Stodart & Dunham. We did not<lb/>
go into the subject quite as thoroughly as we could have wished, from<lb/>
the want of space, but we may have occasion to refer to it again by<lb/>
and bye, and shall be able then to bring some obscure points into<lb/>
strong relief.<lb/>
We have not as yet reported upon the quality of the instruments<lb/>
turned out from this factory, not because we had little to say, but be-<lb/>
cause we thought it better to defer that portion until the concluding<lb/>
notice.<lb/>
Although all Piano Fortes would appear to a common observer to be<lb/>
precisely alike in construction, and although the process of manufac-<lb/>
ture is universally similar, yet the results depend so entirely upon a<lb/>
combination of circumstances, that if two instruments be manufactured<lb/>
from the same material, upon the same scale, and by the same hands,<lb/>
they will be found, in all probability, when completed, to be totally<lb/>
different in quality, and yet no one could discover the slightest dissimi-<lb/>
larity in any portion of the workmanship. It will scarcely be credited,<lb/>
but it is nevertheless a fact, that there are the enormous number of five<lb/>
thousand three hundred and fifteen pieces in every Piano Forte of a<lb/>
large scale. The number seems truly immense, but the small items<lb/>
count up rap dly.<lb/>
The aim of every maker is to produce as much tone of a certain qua-<lb/>
lity, as rapidly and with as little labor to the performer as possible. It<lb/>
is in this particular that each maker differs from the other. Some by<lb/>
a light touch, and a hammer covered in a particular way, produce a<lb/>
quality metallic and brilliant, and some by a powerful lever, a hammer<lb/>
loosely covered, and a badly made spring, produce a wooden, or as it<lb/>
is called, a tubby quality of tone, and this class has the peculiarity,<lb/>
that though the keys be struck never so hard, no more sound can be<lb/>
obtained ; while other makers endeavor to form such a scale (the form<lb/>
by which the strings are adjusted on the instrument) and to regulate<lb/>
the lever to such a nicety, that the medium power of the finger will pro-<lb/>
duce a rich, full, and powerful tone, while an increase of power appli-<lb/>
ed to the keys, will give an increase of tone of the same quality. These<lb/>
in our opinion, have a decided advantage, for though use imparts a<lb/>
brilliancy to them, their tone is not so apt to wear thin and wiry, as is<lb/>
the case with those which are brilliant when new.<lb/>
Of the latter class are Messrs. Stodart & Dunham’s instruments.<lb/>
THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.<lb/>
271<pb n="271"/><lb/>
They are full bodied, rich toned Pianos, with a touch so elastic that<lb/>
it springs to the finger, and a clear, melodious and ringing sound,<lb/>
which may almost be called vocal. The tone does not come out slug-<lb/>
gishly, but is simultaneous with the stroke of the hammer, and in this<lb/>
respect, we consider that they have, in their recent instruments, effect-<lb/>
ed a decided improvement. Of the workmanship, both of the interior<lb/>
and exterior of the instruments, we are enabled through ocular de-<lb/>
monstration, to speak in terms of entire satisfaction, for we have seen<lb/>
every part of the manufacture, and know it to be solid, faithful, and<lb/>
masterly handicraft.<lb/>
In conclusion, we feel assured that whoever purchases an instrument<lb/>
from the store of Stodart & Dunham, will never repent the bargain.<lb/>
To the gentlemanly and obliging proprietors we have to express our<lb/>
thanks for their considerate patience under all our troublesome inqui-<lb/>
ries.<lb/>
MISCELLANY.<lb/>
Puns from the Boston Post.—This witty paper makes<lb/>
the most wicked puns of any periodical in the Union ; we cut three out<lb/>
of the last week’s paper as specimens.<lb/>
Early.—We notice the connubialization of Ezra T. Jones with Miss<lb/>
Sally Ladd, in Chillicothe. Ezra has supplied his table with Sal-Ladd<lb/>

bawled to a good many in Philadelphia, and then went to Bawl-to-<lb/>

Said a gentleman to Digby, at the Shades the other day. “ the Gen-<lb/>
eral is a tine, noble-hearted fellow, and the prince of landlords; but<lb/>
he has one fault, and that is he gives you such a tremendous squeeze<lb/>
of the hand.” “Very true,” replied Digby,” " that is the only vice<lb/>
be has.”<lb/>

Goldsmith’s Writing Academy.—Having visited Mr.<lb/>
Goldsmith’s new and elegant apartments, in the La Farge Buildings,<lb/>
269 Broadway, we can speak with confidence of his admirable arrange-<lb/>
ments. Every thing that can be done to promote the comfort and<lb/>
convenience of the pupil, has been done. The great reduction in Mr.<lb/>
G.’s charges (now $2,50 for a complete course) constantly attracts a<lb/>
large number of pupils, so that every moment of his time is fully occu-<lb/>
pied. This is as it ought to be. We enjoy one great blessing in Ameri-<lb/>
ca—the assurance that merit almost invariably finds its reward. Of<lb/>
Mr. Goldsmith’s high qualifications as a teacher, it is unnecessary to<lb/>
say a word. His “ Gems of Penmanship” speak at least one large vol-<lb/>
ume in his praise ; the daily press admits that, as a Professor of the<lb/>
Calligraphic art, he has no rival on this continent; and five diplomas of<lb/>
the American Institute, awarding him the highest premium for off-hand<lb/>
penmanship, are sufficient evidence that, among the best judges, his<lb/>
skill is largely appreciated.<lb/>
Mr. Murdoch’s Lectures.—We have always regarded<lb/>
Mr. Murdoch as the best elocutionist in America. As an actor he is,<lb/>
perhaps, somewhat deficient in naturalness—vigor—and fulness of a-<lb/>
bandonment to his character, but he always compensates us, in great<lb/>
measure, by effective delivery and grace of gesture. He comprehends,<lb/>
we think, the whole rationale of elocution as well as any man of his<lb/>
time, and his physical powers enable him to give effect to his concep-<lb/>
tions. We shall look with much interest tor a work on Elocution<lb/>
which we understand he is preparing.<lb/>
His lectures at the Society Library have been well attended, and<lb/>
never fail to elicit applause from those whose approbation is of value.<lb/>
State of the Country—Not the country composed of<lb/>
politicians and speculating tradesmen, who appear to be exceedingly<lb/>
anxious for a fight with somebody, about something or nothing, but<lb/>
the country of green fields and budding fruits. It was never in a finer<lb/>
condition thau at present; after a few days of gentle showers, and a<lb/>
few more of west winds and sunshine, the fields have put on their<lb/>
brightest verdure; the suburbs of the city, on Staten Island and Long<lb/>
Island—are nearly smothered in the blossoms of the cherry trees.<lb/>
The swamp maples are putting out their red buds, and the dog-wood<lb/>
is opening his broad white flowers. Everything looks fresh, fragrant<lb/>
and prosperous. The severe frost a fortnight ago injured some of the<lb/>
peach trees in New Jersey, but there will be no lack of fruit the com-<lb/>
ing season.<lb/>

Bertini's Method for the Piano.<lb/>
THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive<lb/>
work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this method<lb/>
the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prom-<lb/>
inent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies, are<lb/>
given in such PROGRESSIVE order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and<lb/>
carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,<lb/>
otherwise are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time<lb/>
has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account,<lb/>
and it is only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will been<lb/>
abled to also music with facility, and at the tame time become good musi<lb/>
cians.<lb/>
This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the rud-<lb/>
ments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each lesson<lb/>
is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.<lb/>
The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from pro-<lb/>
fessional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini’s Method<lb/>
over all others yet published in this country, most of them having used the<lb/>
foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to give a few of the<lb/>

From the Rev. R. T. Huddart, (Classical Academy, Houston street.)<lb/>
It affords me much pleasure to add my testimony to the value, importance,<lb/>
and advantage of Mr. George Vandenhoff’s Work on Elocution. He has<lb/>
aptly styled it “ a plain System:” such it truly is to those who will pursue<lb/>
the instruction given, step by step; and cannot fail of producing a beneficial<lb/>
and much wished for result in one of the departments of education so sadly<lb/>
neglected—correct reading—devoid of vulgarities, and errors in articulation<lb/>
and pronunciation. I hope the book will have a wide circulation, in order<lb/>
that the good which it is capable of effecting may be thus more extensively<lb/>
diffused, and a better system of instruction be afforded to the rising genera-<lb/>
tion. in that which constitutes a mist agreeable accomplishment in every<lb/>
gentleman’s education, namely, “ Logical and Musical Declamation.”<lb/>
