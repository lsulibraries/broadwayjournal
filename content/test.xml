<lb xmlns=""/>HOUSE FURNITURE.
<lb xmlns=""/>In the internal decoration, if not in the external architec-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ture of their residences, the English are supreme. The Ital-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ians have but little sentiment beyond marbles and colors.
<lb xmlns=""/>In France meliora probant, deteriora sequuntur—the people
<lb xmlns=""/>are too much a race of gad-abouts to maintain those house-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>hold proprieties of which, indeed, they have a delicate ap-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>preciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The
<lb xmlns=""/>Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but in-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>appropriate fancy. The Scotch are poor decorists. The
<lb xmlns=""/>Dutch have, perhaps, an indeterminate idea that a curtain is
<lb xmlns=""/>not a cabbage. In Spain they are all curtains a nation of
<lb xmlns=""/>hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The Hottentots
<lb xmlns=""/>and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees
<lb xmlns=""/>alone are preposterous.
<lb xmlns=""/>How this happens it is not difficult to see. We have no
<lb xmlns=""/>aristocracy of blood, and having therefore as a natural, and
<lb xmlns=""/>indeed as an inevitable thing, fashioned for ourselves an aris-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tocracy of dollars, the display of wealth has here to take
<lb xmlns=""/>the place and perform the office of the heraldic display in
<lb xmlns=""/>monarchical countries. By a transition readily understood,
<lb xmlns=""/>and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have
<lb xmlns=""/>been brought to merge in simple show our notions of taste it-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>self.
<lb xmlns=""/>To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no
<lb xmlns=""/>mere parade of costly appurtenances would be so likely as
<lb xmlns=""/>with us, to create an impression of the beautiful in respect
<lb xmlns=""/>to the appurtenances themselves—or of taste as regards the
<lb xmlns=""/>proprietor :—this for the reason, first, that wealth is not, in
<lb xmlns=""/>England, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting a no-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>bility; and secondly, that there the true nobility of blood,
<lb xmlns=""/>confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste,
<lb xmlns=""/>rather avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a
<lb xmlns=""/>parvenu rivalry may at any time be successfully attempted.
<lb xmlns=""/>The people will imitate the nobles, and the result is a tho-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>rough diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America the
<lb xmlns=""/>coins current being the sole arms of the aristocracy, their
<lb xmlns=""/>display may be said, in general, to be the sole means of aris-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tocratic distinction; and the populace, looking always up-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two en-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short,
<lb xmlns=""/>the cost of an article of furniture has at length come to be,
<lb xmlns=""/>with us, nearly the sole test of its merit in a decorative
<lb xmlns=""/>Point of view—and this test, once established, has led the
<lb xmlns=""/>way to many analogous errors, readily traceable to the one
<lb xmlns=""/>primitive folly.
<lb xmlns=""/>There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye
<lb xmlns=""/>of an artist than the interior of what is termed in the United
<lb xmlns=""/>States—that is to say in Appallachia—a well furnished
<lb xmlns=""/>apartment. Its most usual defect is a want of keeping. We
<lb xmlns=""/>speak of the keeping of a room as we would of the keeping
<lb xmlns=""/>of a picture—for both the picture and the room are amena-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ble to those undeviating principles which regulate a varie-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ties of art, and very nearly the same laws by which we de-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cide on the higher merits of a painting, suffice for decision
<lb xmlns=""/>on the adjustment of a chamber.
<lb xmlns=""/>A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the charac-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ter of the several pieces of furniture, but generally in their
<lb xmlns=""/>colors or modes of adaptation to use. Very often the eye
<lb xmlns=""/>is offended by their inartistical arrangement. Straight lines
<lb xmlns=""/>are too prevalent—too uninterruptedly continued—or clum-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>sily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines occur, they
<lb xmlns=""/>are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision
<lb xmlns=""/>the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.
<lb xmlns=""/>Curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen, in re-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>spect to other decorations. With formal furniture curtains
<lb xmlns=""/>are out of place; and an extensive volume of drapery of any
<lb xmlns=""/>kind is, under any circumstances, irreconcilable with good
<lb xmlns=""/>taste: the proper quantum, as well as the proper adjust-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ment, depending upon the character of the general effect.
<lb xmlns=""/>Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days,
<lb xmlns=""/>but we still very frequently err in their patterns and colors.
<lb xmlns=""/>The soul of the apartment is the carpet. From it are de-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>duced not only the hues but the forms of all objects incum-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>bent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary man ; a
<lb xmlns=""/>good judge of a carpet must be a genius. Yet we have heard
<lb xmlns=""/>discoursing of carpets, with the air “ d'un mouton qui réve,”
<lb xmlns=""/>fellows who should not and who could not be entrusted with
<lb xmlns=""/>the management of their own moustaches. Every one knows
<lb xmlns=""/>that a large floor may have a covering of large figures, and
<lb xmlns=""/>that a small one must have a covering of small—yet this is
<lb xmlns=""/>not all the knowledge in the world. As regards texture the
<lb xmlns=""/>Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the preter-pluper-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>fect tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying ago-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>nies. Touching pattern—a carpet should not be bedizzened
<lb xmlns=""/>out like a Riccaree Indian—all red chalk, yellow ochre, and
<lb xmlns=""/>cock’s feathers. In brief—distinct grounds, and vivid circu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>lar or cycloid figures, of no meaning, are here Median laws.
<lb xmlns=""/>The abomination of flowers, or representations of well-known
<lb xmlns=""/>objects of any kind, should not be endured within the limits
<lb xmlns=""/>of Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets, or curtains,
<lb xmlns=""/>or tapestry, or ottoman-coverings, all upholstery of this na-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ture should be rigidly Arabesque. As for those antique floor-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cloths still occasionally seen in the dwellings of the rabble
<lb xmlns=""/>—cloths of huge, sprawling, and radiating devices, stripe-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>interspersed, and glorious with all hues, among which no
<lb xmlns=""/>ground is intelligible,—these are but the wicked invention
<lb xmlns=""/>of a race of time-servers and money-lovers—children of Baal
<lb xmlns=""/>and worshippers of Mammon—Benthams, who to spare
<lb xmlns=""/>thought, and economize fancy, first cruelly invented the Kal-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>eidoscope, and then established joint-stock companies to twirl
<lb xmlns=""/>it by steam.
<lb xmlns=""/>     Glare is a leading error in the philosophy of American
<lb xmlns=""/>household decoration—an error easily recognized as deduced
<lb xmlns=""/>from the perversion of taste just specified. We are violent-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ly enamoured of gas and of glass. The former is totally in-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>admissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady light of-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>fends No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A
<lb xmlns=""/>mild, or what artists term a cool light, with its consequent

<lb xmlns=""/>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
<lb xmlns=""/>warm shadows, will do wonders for even an ill-furnished
<lb xmlns=""/>apartment. Never was a more lovely thought than that of
<lb xmlns=""/>the astral lamp. We mean, of course, the astral lamp pro-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>per— the lamp of Argand, with its original plain ground
<lb xmlns=""/>glass shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays.
<lb xmlns=""/>The cut glass shade is a weak invention of the enemy. The
<lb xmlns=""/>eagerness with which we have adopted it, partly on account
<lb xmlns=""/>of its flashiness, but principally on account of its greater cost,
<lb xmlns=""/>is a good commentary on the proposition with which we be-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>gan. It is not too much to say that the deliberate employ-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>er of a cut glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste,
<lb xmlns=""/>or blindly subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light
<lb xmlns=""/>proceeding from one of these gaudy abominations is unequal,
<lb xmlns=""/>broken, and painful. It alone is sufficient to mar a world of
<lb xmlns=""/>good effect in the furniture subjected to its influence. Fe-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>male loveliness, in especial, is more than one half disenchant-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed beneath its evil eye.
<lb xmlns=""/>In the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false
<lb xmlns=""/>principles. Its leading feature is glitter—and in that one
<lb xmlns=""/>word how much of all that is detestable do we express!
<lb xmlns=""/>Flickering, unquiet lights are sometimes pleasing—to child-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ren and idiots always so—but in the embellishment of a
<lb xmlns=""/>room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth, even
<lb xmlns=""/>strong steady lights are inadmissible. The huge and un-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>meaning glass chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and with-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>out shade, which dangle in our most fashionable drawing-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of all that is false
<lb xmlns=""/>in taste or preposterous in folly.
<lb xmlns=""/>The rage for glitter—because its idea has become, as we
<lb xmlns=""/>before observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the
<lb xmlns=""/>abstract—has led us, also, to the exaggerated employment
<lb xmlns=""/>of mirrors. We line our dwellings with great British plates,
<lb xmlns=""/>and then imagine we have done a fine thing. Now the
<lb xmlns=""/>slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one who
<lb xmlns=""/>has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glass-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>es, and especially of large ones. Regarded apart from its
<lb xmlns=""/>reflection, the mirror presents a continuous, flat, colorless,
<lb xmlns=""/>unrelieved surface—a thing always and obviously unpleasant.
<lb xmlns=""/>Considered as a reflector, it is potent in producing a mon-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>strous and odious uniformity:—and the evil is here aggravat-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of
<lb xmlns=""/>its sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. In fact, a
<lb xmlns=""/>room with four or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all
<lb xmlns=""/>purposes of artistic show, a room of no shape at all. If we
<lb xmlns=""/>add to this evil, the attendant glitter upon glitter, we have a
<lb xmlns=""/>perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing effects. The
<lb xmlns=""/>veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,
<lb xmlns=""/>would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he
<lb xmlns=""/>might be altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatis-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>faction. But let the same person be led into a room taste-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>fully furnished, and he would be startled into an exclamation
<lb xmlns=""/>of pleasure and surprise.
<lb xmlns=""/>It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions,
<lb xmlns=""/>that here a man of large purse has usually a very little soul
<lb xmlns=""/>which he keeps in it. The corruption of taste is a portion
<lb xmlns=""/>or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture. As we grow rich
<lb xmlns=""/>our ideas grow rusty. It is, therefore, not among our aristo-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cracy that we must look (if at all, in Appallachia) for the spi-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>rituality of a British boudoir. But we have seen apartments
<lb xmlns=""/>in the tenure of Americans of modern means—which, in ne-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>gative merit at least, might vie with any of the or-molu'd
<lb xmlns=""/>cabinets of our friends across the water. Even now, there is
<lb xmlns=""/>present to our mind's eye a small and not ostentatious cham-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ber with whose decorations no fault can be found. The pro-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>prietor lies asleep on a sofa—the weather is cool—the time
<lb xmlns=""/>is near midnight—we will make a sketch of the room during
<lb xmlns=""/>his slumber.
<lb xmlns=""/>It is oblong—some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in
<lb xmlns=""/>breadth—a shape affording the best (ordinary) opportunities
<lb xmlns=""/>for the adjustment of furniture. It has but one door—by no
<lb xmlns=""/>means a wide one—which is at one end of the parallelogram,
<lb xmlns=""/>and but two windows, which are at the other. These latter
<lb xmlns=""/>are large, reaching down to the floor—have deep recesses,
<lb xmlns=""/>and open on an Italian veranda. Their panes are of a crim-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>son-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive
<lb xmlns=""/>than usual. They are curtained within the recess, by a thick
<lb xmlns=""/>silver tissue adapted to the shape of the window, and hang-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ing loosely in small volumes. Without the recess are cur-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a deep
<lb xmlns=""/>network of gold, and lined with the silver tissue, which is
<lb xmlns=""/>the material of the exterior blind. There are no cornices;
<lb xmlns=""/>but the folds of the whole fabric (which are sharp rather
<lb xmlns=""/>than massive, and have an airy appearance) issue from be-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>neath a broad entablature of rich gilt work, which encircles
<lb xmlns=""/>the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The dra-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>pery is thrown open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope
<lb xmlns=""/>of gold loosely enveloping it, and resolving itself readily into
<lb xmlns=""/>a knot;—no pins or other such devices are apparent. The
<lb xmlns=""/>colors of the curtains and their fringe—the tints of crimson
<lb xmlns=""/>and gold—appear everywhere in profusion, and determine
<lb xmlns=""/>the character of the room. The carpet, of Saxony material,
<lb xmlns=""/>is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson ground,
<lb xmlns=""/>relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that
<lb xmlns=""/>festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of
<lb xmlns=""/>the ground, and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form
<lb xmlns=""/>a succession of short irregular curves—one occasionally over-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>laying the other. The walls are papered with a glossy paper
<lb xmlns=""/>of a silver grey tint, spotted with small Arabesque devices
<lb xmlns=""/>of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many paintings
<lb xmlns=""/>relieve the expanse of the paper. These are chiefly land-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>scapes of an imaginative cast—such as the fairy grottoes of
<lb xmlns=""/>Stanfield, or the lake of the Dismal Swamp, of Chapman.
<lb xmlns=""/>There are, nevertheless, three or four female heads, of an
<lb xmlns=""/>ethereal beauty—portraits in the manner of Sully. The tone
<lb xmlns=""/>of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no “ brilliant
<lb xmlns=""/>effects.” Repose speaks in all. Not one is of small size.
<lb xmlns=""/>Diminutive paintings give that spotty look to a room, which
<lb xmlns=""/>is the blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched.
<lb xmlns=""/>The frames are broad but not deep, and richly carved, with-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>out being dulled or fillagreed. They have the whole lustre
<lb xmlns=""/>of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls, and do not
<lb xmlns=""/>hang of! with cords. The designs themselves are often seen
<lb xmlns=""/>to better advantage in this latter position, but the general
<lb xmlns=""/>appearance of the chamber is injured. But one mirror, and
<lb xmlns=""/>this not a very large one, is visible. In shape it is nearly
<lb xmlns=""/>circular—and it is hung so that a reflection of the person can
<lb xmlns=""/>be obtained from it in none of the ordinary sitting-places of
<lb xmlns=""/>the room. Two large low sofas of rose-wood and crimson
<lb xmlns=""/>silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats with the exception
<lb xmlns=""/>of two light conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There
<lb xmlns=""/>is a piano-forte (rose-wood also,) without cover, and thrown
<lb xmlns=""/>open. An octagonal table, formed altogether of the richest
<lb xmlns=""/>gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the sofas. This
<lb xmlns=""/>is also without cover—the drapery of the curtains has been
<lb xmlns=""/>thought sufficient. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases,
<lb xmlns=""/>in which bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, oc-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cupy the slightly rounded angles of the room. A tall cande-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>labrum, bearing a small antique lamp with highly perfumed
<lb xmlns=""/>oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some
<lb xmlns=""/>light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and
<lb xmlns=""/>crimson silk cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three
<lb xmlns=""/>hundred magnificently bound books. Beyond these things,
<lb xmlns=""/>there is no furniture, if we except an Argand lamp, with a

<lb xmlns=""/>TWENTIETH ANNUAL EXHIBITION OF THE ACADEMY
<lb xmlns=""/>OF NATIONAL DESIGN.
<lb xmlns=""/>LANDSCAPES.
<lb xmlns=""/>No. 5. View of the Roman Forum.—Chev. Pacetti. A
<lb xmlns=""/>little dingy canvass, with columns and arches, and other ar-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>chitectural shapes, feebly represented on its surface. On
<lb xmlns=""/>turning to the list of exhibitors, we learn that the Chev. Pa-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cetti resides in Rome, which is all the information that we
<lb xmlns=""/>have been able to glean in respect to either the Chev. or his
<lb xmlns=""/>soiled canvass : but we have a great curiosity to learn three
<lb xmlns=""/>things: first, why the Chev. Pacetti’s Roman Forum was
<lb xmlns=""/>brought away from Rome; second, why the same was hung
<lb xmlns=""/>up in the exhibition of the National Academy, and third,
<lb xmlns=""/>what the meaning of Chev. is as applied to a spoiler of can-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>vass on a small scale. If any thing can cure our artists of
<lb xmlns=""/>their absurd practice of making pilgrimages to Rome, it must
<lb xmlns=""/>be the contemplation of such things as this of the Chev. Pa-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cetti’s, and the filthy daub by Rossiter that hangs near it,
<lb xmlns=""/>which were both painted in the atmosphere of the eternal
<lb xmlns=""/>city. Or if these things should not thoroughly wean an honest
<lb xmlns=""/>mind from all yearnings after Italy, surely the comparison
<lb xmlns=""/>of the works produced by the young artists who have never
<lb xmlns=""/>left their native soil, with those by Huntington and Free-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>man in the present exhibition which have been sent home
<lb xmlns=""/>from Rome, must have the effect to do so. We do not find
<lb xmlns=""/>the name of the Chev. Pacetti among the honorary members
<lb xmlns=""/>of the Academy, but it will of course be put there before
<lb xmlns=""/>long.
<lb xmlns=""/>No 16. Landscape—by J. F. Cropsey, A. Here is a very
<lb xmlns=""/>genuine American picture, pervaded wtth great purity of
<lb xmlns=""/>feeling and technical knowledge. The artist has been tied
<lb xmlns=""/>down to the exact features of a particular scene, which he
<lb xmlns=""/>has transferred to his canvass very successfully. The scene
<lb xmlns=""/>is a view of the Saugerties White Lead Works on Esopus
<lb xmlns=""/>Creek in this State. The time is early spring, when the ten-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>der foliage of the trees gives to nature her sweetest aspect.
<lb xmlns=""/>But it is also the most difficult aspect for the painter to re-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>present, for every thiDg is tremulous with new life, and the
<lb xmlns=""/>earth is covered with smiles like the face of an infant.
<lb xmlns=""/>There are in this picture all the elements of a grand land-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>scape, ledges of rocks, a fall of water, beautiful trees, and a
<lb xmlns=""/>clear sky ; but yet a grand landscape has not been formed
<lb xmlns=""/>by their combination, mainly because the artist has aimed to
<lb xmlns=""/>give all the details of a particular locality rather than a
<lb xmlns=""/>point of interest, imbued with a touch of truth and feeling.
<lb xmlns=""/>The rocks are painted with sufficient knowledge for a geolo-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>gist to give them a name, and the trees have a character of
<lb xmlns=""/>their own in form and color, but their beauty is spoiled by
<lb xmlns=""/>too much distinctness in the foliage. The shadows are clear
<lb xmlns=""/>and cool, and the sky is of a quality that we can look into
<lb xmlns=""/>rather than upon; but the water resembles some substance
<lb xmlns=""/>that we have never seen—liquified sandstone, or something
<lb xmlns=""/>like it. The foam upon it is whiling, not the graceful sub-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>stance out of which the goddess of love and beauty bounded
<lb xmlns=""/>into life and action. Of all natural things which the artist
<lb xmlns=""/>strives to pul upon his canvass, water is the most perplexing
<lb xmlns=""/>and intractable; it rarely finds its level in the imagination of
<lb xmlns=""/>the painter, but seems to run from him, and he is generally
<lb xmlns=""/>too indolent to run alter it. There is water enough in the
<lb xmlns=""/>present exhibition, if it possessed the quality of a liquid, to
<lb xmlns=""/>drown the world, yet Sisyphus might walk through the rooms
<lb xmlns=""/>of the Academy without being reminded of his thirst, unless 
<lb xmlns=""/>he caught sight of the water-bucket and tin cup in Mr. Ed-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>monds’ picture of the Truant School Boy. These are sug-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>gestive of water, but the sea scene by Mr. Cole, the rivers of
<lb xmlns=""/>Mr. Durand, the lake by Mr. Inman, and the Niagara Falls
<lb xmlns=""/>by Mr. Havell, to leave the stagnant pool by Mr. Shegogue
<lb xmlns=""/>out of the catalogue, do not, all combined, contain as much
<lb xmlns=""/>moisture as Dives prayed for—one drop. Mr. Havell is ob-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>trusively ambitious of painting water, for he has made an
<lb xmlns=""/>attempt upon Niagara Falls and the North river, and yet he
<lb xmlns=""/> has not given evidence of ability to depict a drop of dew. Of
<lb xmlns=""/>all other painters in the world a New-Yorker is the least
<lb xmlns=""/>excusable for libelling water; with a noble river on each side
<lb xmlns=""/>of the city, a bay of unsurpassed magnificence before him,
<lb xmlns=""/>and fountains dashing their spray in his face as he walks
<lb xmlns=""/>through the street, he must become acquainted with the
<lb xmlns=""/>qualities and appearances of the liquid element. Yet, with
<lb xmlns=""/>all these advantages, we see our artists continually painting
<lb xmlns=""/>lakes of polished steel, and oceans of sheep’s wool. The
<lb xmlns=""/>reason is that they paint pictures in confined rooms, and bor-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>row their waves and water-falls from engravings. But unless
<lb xmlns=""/>an artist is willing to look nature in the face, and strive ho-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>nestly to copy her features, he has no right to make an at-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tempt at representing her, for he will be certain to caricature
<lb xmlns=""/>her. If a young painter be ambitious of fame, and should
<lb xmlns=""/>think to gain it by making pictures of water, let him, instead
<lb xmlns=""/>of making a pilgrimage to Rome, take up his residence on
<lb xmlns=""/>Staten Island, and cross the bay every day in the year, rain
<lb xmlns=""/>or shine, calm or storm, hot or cold. Let him take his seat
<lb xmlns=""/>upon the taffrail of the boat, and never think about a shelter
<lb xmlns=""/>or an umbrella, or coughs or colds, or rheumatic pains, but
<lb xmlns=""/>watch the ever-varying form and color of the water, until
<lb xmlns=""/>his frame shall become invigorated with health, his nerves
<lb xmlns=""/>braced by the pure air, and his soul thoroughly imbued and
<lb xmlns=""/>saturated with living palpable ideas of the glorious beauty
<lb xmlns=""/>of the sea: its motion, moisture, transparency, and ever
<lb xmlns=""/>changing but ever beautiful forms. Let him each day note
<lb xmlns=""/>down his thoughts, and if at the end of the year he can re-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>present upon his canvass one wave with the light palpitating
<lb xmlns=""/>through its translucent form, or flashing in its dancing spray,
<lb xmlns=""/>he will have laid the corner stone of an immortality and a
<lb xmlns=""/>life of honor. But even though he should not be able to do
<lb xmlns=""/>this to the degree that will satisfy his own aspirations, he
<lb xmlns=""/>will have spent a year of delight that will freshen his after-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>life, and have gained an amount of knowledge, that will, at
<lb xmlns=""/>least, impart to his productions a degree of grace and beauty
<lb xmlns=""/>which, otherwise, they could never have possessed. The bay
<lb xmlns=""/>of New York is the happiest spot in the whole world to form
<lb xmlns=""/>a painter, because it has all the qualities that water can pos-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>sess; it has the rapid current of a river, the breadth, depth,
<lb xmlns=""/>and motion of the sea, and the placidity and quiet of a lake.
<lb xmlns=""/>Its surface, too, is covered at all times, with all the different
<lb xmlns=""/>forms of boats that float—the canal boats from the interior,
<lb xmlns=""/>the pleasure yacht, the skiff, river craft, galliots, war vessels,
<lb xmlns=""/>steamers and merchant ships. There is not another port in
<lb xmlns=""/>the United States where the same variety of navigation may
<lb xmlns=""/>be found. But beyond all these advantages for the painter
<lb xmlns=""/>are the shores which bind this matchless bay ; the wooded
<lb xmlns=""/>hills, the palisades, the low beach, the ledges of rocks, the
<lb xmlns=""/>fairy islands, with their demon-like fortifications, the city
<lb xmlns=""/>rising from the sea, the promontories, light-houses, castle-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>crowned heights and rocky precipices. Yet our artists give
<lb xmlns=""/>us none of these glories on their canvasses. Mr. Cole has
<lb xmlns=""/>gone down to Frenchman's bay, four or five hundred miles
<lb xmlns=""/>off towards the North Pole, and has come back and painted
<lb xmlns=""/>a pea-green sea with ledges of red rocks; Huntington has
<lb xmlns=""/>gone to Tuscany, and sent home a landscape with prismatic
<lb xmlns=""/>hills and a rivulet of soap-suds; Inman went to Cumberland,
<lb xmlns=""/>276
<lb xmlns=""/>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
<lb xmlns=""/>and sent here a back and purple and pea-green lake, with
<lb xmlns=""/>hills and trees of the same complexion: but our magnificent
<lb xmlns=""/>bay has not been able to furnish either of these New-Yorkers
<lb xmlns=""/>an idea for his canvass. We would not have them paint dio-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ramic views of the bay as some painters attempt to do, and
<lb xmlns=""/>so fail of doing any thing, but let them take one ray of light,
<lb xmlns=""/>one wave, one hill, one cloud, one sun-set, one of our twi-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>lights, one of our ships or sloops, or barges, or steamboats—
<lb xmlns=""/>objects as full of poetry and romantic interest as any that can
<lb xmlns=""/>be found in Venice or Naples, and transfer it to their canvass,
<lb xmlns=""/>that there may be something on the walls of the Academy
<lb xmlns=""/>to appeal to the understandings and touch the hearts of those
<lb xmlns=""/>who crowd to look upon them. The great defect of every
<lb xmlns=""/>one of our landscape painters is an ambition to do everything
<lb xmlns=""/>upon one canvass. But in nature the eye will make for itself
<lb xmlns=""/>a point of interest, for it can comprehend but one thing at a
<lb xmlns=""/>time. Therefore the artist should never attempt to make
<lb xmlns=""/>two pictures on one canvass, for the eye cannot accommo-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>date itself to both, and in glancing from one to the other,
<lb xmlns=""/>the interest of both will be destroyed. When we walk into
<lb xmlns=""/>the fields, or climb a mountain, or go out to sea, the eye and
<lb xmlns=""/>mind immediately seek out a particular object for contempla-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tion, and all except the object selected immediately becomes
<lb xmlns=""/>a confused blank. If we look at a rock near by, we cannot
<lb xmlns=""/>see the distant hills; if we look at a flower at our feet, we
<lb xmlns=""/>cannot see the tree above our heads; if we gaze at the
<lb xmlns=""/>purple hills in the distance, we lose the green ones near by.
<lb xmlns=""/>A painter, therefore, should select his point of interest, and
<lb xmlns=""/>invest it with all the life and truth that his powers will al-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>low, and only try to avoid giving the same degree of finish to
<lb xmlns=""/>any other part of his picture ; then the spectator will have a
<lb xmlns=""/>key to his thoughts, and be spared the perplexity of trying to
<lb xmlns=""/>discern what he desired to accomplish. The pictures by Cole
<lb xmlns=""/>and Durand, in the present exhibition, contain within them-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>selves dozens of other pictures, and the eye wanders from
<lb xmlns=""/>object to object, from sight to shadow, from men here to cat-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tle yonder, seeking in vain after repose and a point to pause
<lb xmlns=""/>and hold communion with the artist. The Landscape, 39,
<lb xmlns=""/>by Durand, is wearying both to the eye and the mind, be-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cause you keep travelling over it for a place to rest upon and
<lb xmlns=""/>begin to drink its beauty. Here is an old man sitting in the
<lb xmlns=""/>cool shadow of the trees—you, are content to sit and rest
<lb xmlns=""/>also, and as you look upon him, sympathise with his feel-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ings—but you cannot rest; a group of young men playing at
<lb xmlns=""/>ball are twitching away your eyes and distracting your
<lb xmlns=""/>thoughts; you pass to them, but beyond is a glimpse of
<lb xmlns=""/>bewitching sun-shine stealing through the trees which you
<lb xmlns=""/>must enjoy, and you leave the cricketers for the sun-shine,
<lb xmlns=""/>and that for the people at the farm-house door, and them for
<lb xmlns=""/>the man with the load of hay, and him for the clump of
<lb xmlns=""/>chesnut trees, and them for the objects in the foreground. The
<lb xmlns=""/>mind is wearied and dissatisfied ; the heart is not touched—
<lb xmlns=""/>you feel pettish and—without knowing what to find fault
<lb xmlns=""/>with, for the picture is really made up of most admirable
<lb xmlns=""/>materials—condemn it in your heart while you pronounce it
<lb xmlns=""/>with your tongue a magnificent work.
<lb xmlns=""/>There is hardly a landscape in the rooms in which you
<lb xmlns=""/>can discover with certainty the intent of the painter, beyond
<lb xmlns=""/>the very obvious one of catching the eye of a gaping crowd.
<lb xmlns=""/>There are a few which seem to have been painted with a
<lb xmlns=""/>sentiment of Nature in the artist's mind, and these make the
<lb xmlns=""/>most forcible appeal to the heart of the spectator. No. 37,
<lb xmlns=""/>a study from Nature, by Cropsey, is a very truthful picture;
<lb xmlns=""/>the rocks are the best of any in the exhibition; the shadows
<lb xmlns=""/>are clear and distinct; the light pure and bright, and the lit-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tle bit of water is limpid and cool, although it is smooth as a
<lb xmlns=""/>mirror. The picture does not stand out from the canvass, as
<lb xmlns=""/>we hear amateurs absurdly say, sometimes, when they mis-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>take the gross faults of a painting for its beauties, but it takes
<lb xmlns=""/>you into the canvass as you stand and look at it, and if you
<lb xmlns=""/>saw it by itself, would doubtless make you forget that you
<lb xmlns=""/>were looking at a picture at all. The pictures in a promis-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cuous collection are seen lo very great disadvantage; the eye
<lb xmlns=""/>and the mind are distracted by the varieties of style, of objects
<lb xmlns=""/>and of color. Artists paint to attract admirers, and modest
<lb xmlns=""/>nature is trampled upon like violets in a garden of sun-flow-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ers. No. 177, an October landscape, by J. R. Bleecker, is a
<lb xmlns=""/>charming little bit of tender feeling ; an artist whose love of
<lb xmlns=""/>the true and beautiful leads him to scorn the flaunting gew-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>gaws by which vulgar minds seek to gain applause, and
<lb xmlns=""/>contents himself to copy nature as he finds her, will run the
<lb xmlns=""/>risk of being thrust into a bye-place as this little painting has
<lb xmlns=""/>been. But he should work on and bide his time—his day
<lb xmlns=""/>will dawn by-and-bye. There is a most charming little
<lb xmlns=""/>painting by Mr. Casilear, in the rooms of the Art-Union in
<lb xmlns=""/>Broadway, which should have been sent to the exhibition.
<lb xmlns=""/>It is a perfectly painted oak tree, with a couple of horses
<lb xmlns=""/>resting in its shadow ; it is very simple, very highly finished,
<lb xmlns=""/>and full of genuine love of nature and high artistic expres-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>sion. It is worth an acre of the stumps of trees, and maho-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>gany looking rocks which occupy so large a part of the walls
<lb xmlns=""/>of the National Academy.
<lb xmlns=""/>113, 168, 236. Three Landscapes, by R. A. Powers—are
<lb xmlns=""/>from the pencil of an artist of whom we have never heard
<lb xmlns=""/>before; but we feel confident from the merit which each
<lb xmlns=""/>contains, that we shall hear from him again to better advan-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tage.
<lb xmlns=""/>153, 160, 306, by W. W, Wotherspoon—are the most pro-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>mising pictures in the exhibition. They are very strongly
<lb xmlns=""/>marked by a decided manner; but the artist was born a land-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>scape painter, and his manner must be rather a choice than
<lb xmlns=""/>a necessity. He must look a little closer into Nature, and
<lb xmlns=""/>free himself of his present manner, before it becomes a de-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cided habit. The best part of his picture is the drawing;
<lb xmlns=""/>the color is monotonous and untrue.
<lb xmlns=""/>117. View on Long Island—J. H. Cafferty. A quiet, un-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>obtrusive piece of nature. We have seen the tree before—
<lb xmlns=""/>but we are never loth to meet such an acquaintance a second
<lb xmlns=""/>time.
<lb xmlns=""/>321, 324, Landscapes—by F. E. Church, of Catskill, a pu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>pil of Mr. Cole’s. These little pictures give evidence of ge-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>nius in the painter. They are somewhat crude, but they
<lb xmlns=""/>contain touching little effects, which many works of greater
<lb xmlns=""/>pretensions lack. The red clouds in the sunset, 321, are
<lb xmlns=""/>painted with beautiful effect.
<lb xmlns=""/>30. Sunset—by C. P. Cranch. There are many good things
<lb xmlns=""/>in this picture, and many weak parts. The sky is given with
<lb xmlns=""/>good effect, and the shadows are cool and transparent; but
<lb xmlns=""/>the picture is too large for the subject. Mr. Cranch has four
<lb xmlns=""/>more landscapes in the exhibition, which all possess some
<lb xmlns=""/>good touches, but he would do well to exhibit more sparsely
<lb xmlns=""/>until he has had more practice and become more familiar
<lb xmlns=""/>with nature.
<lb xmlns=""/>88. View across Frenchman's Bay from Mount Desert
<lb xmlns=""/>Island, after a squall—T. Cole. This is the only marine
<lb xmlns=""/>picture that we have seen by Mr. Cole. The water is well
<lb xmlns=""/>drawn, but not well colored, and the rocks are of a kind that
<lb xmlns=""/>no geologist would find a name for; the whole coast of
<lb xmlns=""/>Maine is lined with rocks nearly black in color, and tinged
<lb xmlns=""/>with a greenish hue, as all marine rcoks are. These in Mr.
<lb xmlns=""/>Coles’s picture are red. An artist should be something of a
<lb xmlns=""/>geologist to paint rocky scenes correctly, as he should be a
<lb xmlns=""/>botanist to paint flowers, and an anatomist to paint the hu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>man form. The picture is a good deal too large. So wide a
<lb xmlns=""/>surface for so meagre a subject must be filled up chiefly with
<lb xmlns=""/>common places ; a few inches of canvass will serve to convey
<lb xmlns=""/>as vivid an idea of the sea, if properly covered, as a yard;
<lb xmlns=""/>as much breadth of effect can be given in the palm of your
<lb xmlns=""/>hand, as on a canvass twenty feet wide; why, then, should
<lb xmlns=""/>artists waste their materials in painting enormous pictures,
<lb xmlns=""/>whose sizes alone will prevent their being purchased. No.
<lb xmlns=""/>97, by the same artist, is too large for any ordinary room,
<lb xmlns=""/>and the sublime idea of the subject is lost in its expansion.
<lb xmlns=""/>We have been told that this great picture was painted in
<lb xmlns=""/>four days, which is time enough, but if it had been painted
<lb xmlns=""/>within the space of four inches, it would have been infinitely
<lb xmlns=""/>more impressive. 178—a sunset, is one of Mr. Cole's weak-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>est pictures ; it is evidently a composition, and it appears to
<lb xmlns=""/>worse advantage for being put in an oval frame. Mr. Cole
<lb xmlns=""/>still reigns supreme in landscape, as we doubt not he will
<lb xmlns=""/>long continue to do. But he does not always paint with the
<lb xmlns=""/>same power. His two pictures in the rooms of the Art-Union
<lb xmlns=""/>are much finer than either of those in the exhibition; they
<lb xmlns=""/>are among the very best American landscapes ever painted.
<lb xmlns=""/>No. 125, 133, 140, 226. Landscapes—by John F. Kencett,
<lb xmlns=""/>now in England. These pictures of English scenery con-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tain much that is pleasing and true to nature. They are
<lb xmlns=""/>evidently studies; but they are too highly elaborated. The
<lb xmlns=""/>strange effect of light in No. 140, a view near Richmond,
<lb xmlns=""/>appears like an attempt to imitate some of the startling ef-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>fects of Turner. It may be true, but all truths are not pro-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>per for circulation.
<lb xmlns=""/>No. 71. Land Storm—T. Doughty, H. A most excellent

<lb xmlns=""/>MY VILLAGE HOME.
<lb xmlns=""/>In dreams sweet thoughts of thee will come,
<lb xmlns=""/>I see thee yet once more,
<lb xmlns=""/>My own, my happy Village-Home,
<lb xmlns=""/>As lovely as of yore.
<lb xmlns=""/>I see the snow-white cottage stand
<lb xmlns=""/>Amid its leafy bowers,
<lb xmlns=""/>Surrounded by a fairy land,
<lb xmlns=""/>A Paradise of flowers.
<lb xmlns=""/>I see the shade the willow throws,
<lb xmlns=""/>The stately poplar trees,
<lb xmlns=""/>The woodbine and the blushing rose
<lb xmlns=""/>Whose fragrance fills the breeze.
<lb xmlns=""/>I wander by the river-side,
<lb xmlns=""/>A young child free from care,
<lb xmlns=""/>And mark the meadow spreading wide,
<lb xmlns=""/>The cattle browsing there.
<lb xmlns=""/>Beneath a gently-sloping hill
<lb xmlns=""/>I see the streamlet steal,
<lb xmlns=""/>Whose waters seek the village mill,
<lb xmlns=""/>And turn its busy wheel.
<lb xmlns=""/>Afar, my wandering eyes behold
<lb xmlns=""/>The lowly house of prayer,
<lb xmlns=""/>Where oft the faithful of the fold
<lb xmlns=""/>In reverence meek repair.
<lb xmlns=""/>And one spot dearer still than all
<lb xmlns=""/>My heart can ne’er forget,
<lb xmlns=""/>The forest-walk, the waterfall,
<lb xmlns=""/>Where oft in youth I met
<lb xmlns=""/>A fair young girl, whose lustrous eyes
<lb xmlns=""/>No longer smile or weep, 
<lb xmlns=""/>For in the church-yard lone she lies,
<lb xmlns=""/>In deep and dreamless sleep.
<lb xmlns=""/>There is no old familiar place
<lb xmlns=""/>Beloved in boyish years,
<lb xmlns=""/>That I cannot distinctly trace
<lb xmlns=""/>Athwart my falling tears.
<lb xmlns=""/>And even in my dream I grieve
<lb xmlns=""/>That I could wish to roam,
<lb xmlns=""/>And marvel I could ever leave
<lb xmlns=""/>My happy Village Home.

<lb xmlns=""/>LIVING ARTISTS OF EUROPE.
<lb xmlns=""/>No. 2.
<lb xmlns=""/>HORACE VERNET.
<lb xmlns=""/>Three generations of the family of Vernet have rendered
<lb xmlns=""/>the name famous in the annals of the French school. They
<lb xmlns=""/>were originally from Avignon, in which city was born Jo-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>seph Vernet, the grandfather of the subject of this notice, and
<lb xmlns=""/>the first of the three celebrated men, each of whom, in his
<lb xmlns=""/>time, has so identified himself with the progress of Art. The
<lb xmlns=""/>father of Joseph Vernet was a landscape painter, by whom it
<lb xmlns=""/>is said there exist in the department of Vaucluse creditable
<lb xmlns=""/>examples of talent. Marine painting was the department of
<lb xmlns=""/>Art in which Joseph Vernet excelled, and in this he surpass-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed all the French artists of his time. His son, Carl Vernet,
<lb xmlns=""/>acquired an extensive reputation from his historical pictures
<lb xmlns=""/>and battle pieces; this last is the father of the yet more fa-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>mous Vernet of our own epoch.
<lb xmlns=""/>Jean Emile Horace Vernet was born in Paris on the 30th
<lb xmlns=""/>of June, 1789, in the Louvre, in which palace both his fa-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ther and grandfather occupied apartments. Born at a period
<lb xmlns=""/>when education was little cared for in France, he was aban-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>doned almost entirely to the guidance of his own natural in-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tonations, which, in default of that kind of instruction,
<lb xmlns=""/>adapted for children of his age, turned his undivided atten-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tion to Art. He exhibited, therefore, very early, a capacity
<lb xmlns=""/>for drawing—crayons and pencils were his first toys, and his
<lb xmlns=""/>practice with these he soon began to aid with a knowledge
<lb xmlns=""/>of anatomy and perspective. His first instructions in draw-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ing he received from his father, and he afterwards worked
<lb xmlns=""/>some time in the atelier of M. Vincent, a painter of some
<lb xmlns=""/>celebrity under the Consulate.
<lb xmlns=""/>The first money received by Horace Vernet, in the exer-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cise of his profession, was while he was yet in childhood :
<lb xmlns=""/>in boyhood he was an independent member of the Art. At
<lb xmlns=""/>the age of eleven years he made a drawing of a tulip for
<lb xmlns=""/>Madame de Perigord, for which she paid him twenty-four
<lb xmlns=""/>sous; and at the age of thirteen he had commissions inso-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>much as to be in a condition to support himself. One of his
<lb xmlns=""/>earliest efforts was the vignette which, according to the taste
<lb xmlns=""/>of the times, headed the card of invitation to the imperial
<lb xmlns=""/>hunting parties, which was of such merit that an engraver
<lb xmlns=""/>of considerable reputation—Duplessis Bertaut—did not hesi-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tate to pronounce it worthy of his own burin.
<lb xmlns=""/>Commissions began to flow in upon the young Vernet—
<lb xmlns=""/>drawings at six francs, and pictures at twenty. He worked
<lb xmlns=""/>principally for the Journal des Modes, for which he became
<lb xmlns=""/>the acknowledged draughtsman ; and it was, perhaps, from
<lb xmlns=""/>his experience in this department of Art, that he acquired
<lb xmlns=""/>that power in caricature with which he even now amuses
<lb xmlns=""/>his intimate friends ; and often at their own cost.
<lb xmlns=""/>Carle Vernet, who had gained the travelling pension,
<lb xmlns=""/>wished his son should win the same distinction ; but Horace
<lb xmlns=""/>failed in competition for this honor, as he had already done
<lb xmlns=""/>upon every occasion hitherto of his disputing the academic
<lb xmlns=""/>palm. The taste for classic history and mythology prevailed
<lb xmlns=""/>at this time in its full force in France, and Horace Vernet
<lb xmlns=""/>was among the first of the French artists who saw that the
<lb xmlns=""/>Greeks and Romans had already had their day, and to un-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>derstand that he was one of those who were assisting at a
<lb xmlns=""/>grand crisis in Art, in conjunction with a grand crisis in his-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tory, and that the particular period would claim for itself
<lb xmlns=""/>those great men who should signalize themselves amid the
<lb xmlns=""/>turmoil of their times. Moved by a natural inclination for a
<lb xmlns=""/>military life, and having served some time in the ranks of
<lb xmlns=""/>the French army, he was an enthusiastic admirer of Napole-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>on ; it is not, therefore, surprising that he should have early
<lb xmlns=""/>devoted himself to the celebration of the achievements of the
<lb xmlns=""/>French armies and their adored chief; and, although his
<lb xmlns=""/>power is universal, it is yet in this kind of composition in
<lb xmlns=""/>which we find it most emphatically pronounced.
<lb xmlns=""/>In order to check a strong inclination for a military career,
<lb xmlns=""/>he was induced by his father to marry at an early age; thus
<lb xmlns=""/>at twenty he took upon himself the cares of a household, for
<lb xmlns=""/>which, as his family was rich only in reputation, his exer-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tions were now taxed to provide; hence, to those habits of
<lb xmlns=""/>industry, seconded by his marvellous facility of execution, he
<lb xmlns=""/>is indebted for the reputation of being the most prolific artist
<lb xmlns=""/>that ever existed, having, up to the present time, made more
<lb xmlns=""/>than 1200 drawings, nearly 1000 portraits, all of important
<lb xmlns=""/>persons, and at least 300 pictures, many of which are large
<lb xmlns=""/>and complex compositions.
<lb xmlns=""/>In 1814 he was enrolled in the Legion of Honor for the
<lb xmlns=""/>active part which he had taken in the defence of Paris; and
<lb xmlns=""/>in 1925 he was promoted to the grade of officer by Charles
<lb xmlns=""/>X.; and in 1842 he was appointed commander of the order,
<lb xmlns=""/>by the present king of the French, a distinction at which he,
<lb xmlns=""/>of all the French School of Art, has alone arrived. In 1826
<lb xmlns=""/>he was elected a member of the Institute, where, in the
<lb xmlns=""/>class of Fine Arts, he took his place by the side of his father,
<lb xmlns=""/>who long before him had been similarly placed in the old
<lb xmlns=""/>Academy of Painting.
<lb xmlns=""/>In August, 1828, Horace Vernet was appointed Director
<lb xmlns=""/>of the French Academy at Rome, an office which he filled
<lb xmlns=""/>until the first of January, 1839. During his residence at
<lb xmlns=""/>Rome M. Vernet sent as a present to Charles X. an admira-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ble portrait of Pope Pius VIII., which is ranked among the
<lb xmlns=""/>best productions of its author, and now occupies a place in
<lb xmlns=""/>the Museum at Versailles. The king, being charmed with
<lb xmlns=""/>this act of graceful homage, caused the secretary of the em-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>bassy to Rome to be charged to ascertain what return on the
<lb xmlns=""/>part of the king would be most grateful and flattering to the
<lb xmlns=""/>artist; and to learn particularly whether the title of baron
<lb xmlns=""/>would be agreeable to him. The office of discovering his
<lb xmlns=""/>feelings in this latter respect fell to the lot of one of his par-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ticular friends, to whom he replied—“The name of Vernet
<lb xmlns=""/>278
<lb xmlns=""/>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
<lb xmlns=""/>for a painter seems to me sufficiently good without any ho-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>norary title ; the name has shot forth from the crowd, and,
<lb xmlns=""/>in my opinion, the title of baron would again obscure it; but
<lb xmlns=""/>if his Majesty (as you assure me he is) be disposed to accord
<lb xmlns=""/>me that which would afford me the greatest pleasure, say
<lb xmlns=""/>that I pray his Majesty to grant the distinction of the Legion
<lb xmlns=""/>of Honour to M. Dumont, a sculptor, and one of our pension-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>naires, who has just executed a group of the highest merit.”
<lb xmlns=""/>Vernet was not made a baron, nor did Dumont upon that
<lb xmlns=""/>occasion receive the cross, although he has since acquired
<lb xmlns=""/>that honor, and even been also enrolled a member of the In-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>stitute.
<lb xmlns=""/>When the revolution of 1830 broke out, the whole of the
<lb xmlns=""/>French legation at Rome retired to Naples, where the am-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>bassador had already been for some time, and thus the Di-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>rector of the Academy was left at Rome alone, the only
<lb xmlns=""/>French functionary that remained there, in which position of
<lb xmlns=""/>affairs M. Veruet was nominated the diplomatic representa-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tive of France at the Holy See—a signal distinction for an
<lb xmlns=""/>artist—with full powers to treat directly with the Papal Go-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>vernment, and amid circumstances of great difficulty. He
<lb xmlns=""/>acquitted himself, however, with such firmness and judg-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ment as to gain the entire and unqualified approbation of the
<lb xmlns=""/>French government; the expression of which was conveyed
<lb xmlns=""/>to him in a letter written by M. Guizot, then Minister of the
<lb xmlns=""/>Interior.
<lb xmlns=""/>The manner in which this great artist relaxes from his
<lb xmlns=""/>professional labors is by travel ; and during these periods of
<lb xmlns=""/>diversion he has visited many distant countries, as Egypt,
<lb xmlns=""/>Syria, and Algeria, as well as having travelled through all
<lb xmlns=""/>the European states, and having been presented to almost all
<lb xmlns=""/>the sovereigns who have lived in his time. He possesses an
<lb xmlns=""/>assemblage of endowments with which few men have been
<lb xmlns=""/>gifted, or at least, being so, have turned to such account.
<lb xmlns=""/>His conversation is light, most agreeable, and full of anec-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>dote, and, under apparent inattention, be conceals a deep and
<lb xmlns=""/>penetrating observation. His memory is singularly reten-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tive of facts, forms, and localities, insomuch that he can de-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>scribe with exactitude, and after a lapse of years, a place
<lb xmlns=""/>which he may have seen but once ; and so entirely has he
<lb xmlns=""/>reduced this wonderful force of memory to professional pur-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>poses, that he can paint the portrait of a person with whom
<lb xmlns=""/>he may have passed an hour in conversation. His reading is
<lb xmlns=""/>confined almost to the Bible; it was the Scriptures that first
<lb xmlns=""/>inspired him with the desire of visiting the East; and with
<lb xmlns=""/>respect to his travels in the Holy Land, after close and elabo-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>rate research, and observation, he declares his conviction,
<lb xmlns=""/>that the habits and costumes of the Arabs of the present day,
<lb xmlns=""/>are, with little change, the same as they were in the days
<lb xmlns=""/>of the patriarchs. As regards the long catalogue of his
<lb xmlns=""/>works, this is to be explained by reference to his teeming
<lb xmlns=""/>imagination and happy adaptation of subject-matter, rapidity
<lb xmlns=""/>of execution, earnestness of purpose, and uninterrupted good
<lb xmlns=""/>health. Albeit his works are so numerous, and of charac-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ter so diverse, he cannot anywhere be charged with imi-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tation—it is sufficiently evident in all that the inspira-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tion is from actual nature, or has its source in his own
<lb xmlns=""/>vivid imagery—and this is the more apparent that in his
<lb xmlns=""/>works there is no self-repetition. Observation and study
<lb xmlns=""/>of nature are considered by him two grand principles of ex-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cellence. As Professor of the School of Fine Arts, his in-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>structions are considered by the students more serviceable
<lb xmlns=""/>than those of any of the other eleven professors. It is not
<lb xmlns=""/>the classes alone of this admirable institution that profit by
<lb xmlns=""/>the instructions of M. Vernet; nor is it merely to his own
<lb xmlns=""/>countrymen that they are confined ; for he receives in his own
<lb xmlns=""/>atelier, with the utmost kindness and amenity, students of
<lb xmlns=""/>all nations, to whom he offers freely his valuable counsel
<lb xmlns=""/>and best advice. With respect to the measure and the re-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ward of his labors, of these he never thinks in comparison ;
<lb xmlns=""/>for the picture which he intends as a work of love, or a sim-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ple gift, he elaborates as highly as that for which he receives
<lb xmlns=""/>a princely reward.
<lb xmlns=""/>Like all men of superior genius, M. Vernet has his ardent
<lb xmlns=""/>admirers and determined detractors; but the test of time and
<lb xmlns=""/>the public voice are of infinitely more weight than such a
<lb xmlns=""/>complexity of praise and censure. Thirty years of success,
<lb xmlns=""/>and an ever-increasing popularity, have placed Horace Ver-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>net in the highest rank of the profession of Art—a position
<lb xmlns=""/>awarded to him first by the mass of his countrymen, and
<lb xmlns=""/>acknowledged by the rest of Europe.
<lb xmlns=""/>The works of no artist are more extensively known, or
<lb xmlns=""/>more eminently popular than those of M. Vernet, because
<lb xmlns=""/>in the commonest human incidents he sees pictures: and
<lb xmlns=""/>gives, accordingly, a version of them which comes at once
<lb xmlns=""/>home to the heart. Horace Vernet has been the first to break
<lb xmlns=""/>decidedly away from the dull classic formality of the French
<lb xmlns=""/>School, and to exhibit to its members the real fingering of
<lb xmlns=""/>the chords of the social affections.
<lb xmlns=""/>THE SLEEPER.
<lb xmlns=""/>At midnight, in the month of June,
<lb xmlns=""/>I stand beneath the mystic moon.
<lb xmlns=""/>An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,
<lb xmlns=""/>Exhales from out her golden rim,
<lb xmlns=""/>And, softly dripping, drop by drop,
<lb xmlns=""/>Upon the quiet mountain top,
<lb xmlns=""/>Steals drowsily and musically
<lb xmlns=""/>Into the universal valley.
<lb xmlns=""/>The rosemary nods upon the grave ;
<lb xmlns=""/>The lily lolls upon the wave;
<lb xmlns=""/>Wrapping the fog about its breast,
<lb xmlns=""/>The ruin moulders into rest;
<lb xmlns=""/>Looking like Lethe, see ! the lake
<lb xmlns=""/>A conscious slumber seems to take,
<lb xmlns=""/>And would not, for the world, awake.
<lb xmlns=""/>All Beauty sleeps !—and lo ! where lies
<lb xmlns=""/>(Her casement open to the skies)
<lb xmlns=""/>Irene, with her Destinies !
<lb xmlns=""/>Oh, lady bright ! can it be right—
<lb xmlns=""/>This window open to the night ?
<lb xmlns=""/>The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
<lb xmlns=""/>Laughingly through the lattice drop—
<lb xmlns=""/>The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
<lb xmlns=""/>Flit through thy chamber in and out,
<lb xmlns=""/>And wave the curtain canopy
<lb xmlns=""/>So fitfully—so fearfully—
<lb xmlns=""/>Above the closed and fringed lid
<lb xmlns=""/>’Neath which thy slumb’ring soul lies hid,
<lb xmlns=""/>That, o’er the floor and down the wall,
<lb xmlns=""/>Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
<lb xmlns=""/>Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear ?
<lb xmlns=""/>Why and what art thou dreaming here ?
<lb xmlns=""/>Sure thou art come o’er far-off seas,
<lb xmlns=""/>A wonder to these garden trees !
<lb xmlns=""/>Strange is thy pallor ! strange thy dress !
<lb xmlns=""/>Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
<lb xmlns=""/>And this all solemn silentness!
<lb xmlns=""/>The lady sleeps ! Oh, may her sleep,
<lb xmlns=""/>Which is enduring, so be deep
<lb xmlns=""/>Heaven have her in its sacred keep !
<lb xmlns=""/>This chamber changed for one more holy,
<lb xmlns=""/>This bed for one more melancholy,
<lb xmlns=""/>I pray to God that she may lie
<lb xmlns=""/>Forever with unopen’d eye,
<lb xmlns=""/>While the dim sheeted ghosts go by !
<lb xmlns=""/>My love, she sleeps ! Oh, may her sleep,
<lb xmlns=""/>As it is lasting, so be deep !
<lb xmlns=""/>Soft may the worms about her creep !
<lb xmlns=""/>Far in the forest, dim and old,
<lb xmlns=""/>For her may some toll vault unfold—
<lb xmlns=""/>Some vault that oft hath flung its black
<lb xmlns=""/>And winged pannels fluttering back,
<lb xmlns=""/>Triumphant, o’er the crested palls
<lb xmlns=""/>Of her grand family funerals—
<lb xmlns=""/>Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
<lb xmlns=""/>Against whose portal she hath thrown,
<lb xmlns=""/>In childhood, many an idle stone—
<lb xmlns=""/>Some tomb from out whose sounding door
<lb xmlns=""/>She ne’er shall force an echo more,
<lb xmlns=""/>Thrilling to think, poor child of sin !
<lb xmlns=""/>It was the dead who groaned within.

<lb xmlns=""/>THE GRATEFUL CLERK,
<lb xmlns=""/>A T.ALE  FOUNDED ON FACTS.
<lb xmlns=""/>Mr. Hubs was head salesman in the wholesale jobbing
<lb xmlns=""/>store of Hinks and Whipple; he was looked upon as one of
<lb xmlns=""/>the best judges of satinets in Cedar street, as he well might
<lb xmlns=""/>be, for he was a judge of nothing else. He knew nothing of
<lb xmlns=""/>men, manners, metaphysics, or muslins: nothing of politics,
<lb xmlns=""/>pictures, poetry, or poplins; of sects, sciences, or satins. He
<lb xmlns=""/>knew nothing of literature, linens, or love. No, he knew
<lb xmlns=""/>nothing about love, although he thought that he did, for a
<lb xmlns=""/>young lady in Division street, whose mother kept a fancy
<lb xmlns=""/>store, by some witchery induced Mr. Hubs to offer himself;
<lb xmlns=""/>he did so because he thought that he was in love: but any-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>body who had ever been in that condition, could tell at a
<lb xmlns=""/>glance that John Hubs was a stranger to the passion. His
<lb xmlns=""/>forehead was too narrow, and the back part of his head was
<lb xmlns=""/>all shrunk away, or rather it had never been filled out.
<lb xmlns=""/>There was no more love in him than in a winter squash.
<lb xmlns=""/>It was his misfortune that he could not love. Poor Hubs!
<lb xmlns=""/>I could sooner spare a tear for such a fellow-being, than for
<lb xmlns=""/>the loss of an estate like Astor’s. To live in a world which
<lb xmlns=""/>has nothing in it but love worth living for, and to be denied
<lb xmlns=""/>that!
<lb xmlns=""/>Notwithstanding that Hubs had a faint impression that he
<lb xmlns=""/>was in love, it is by no means certain that he would have
<lb xmlns=""/>married for that reason alone. His employers had made an
<lb xmlns=""/>addition of two hundred dollars per annum to his salary, and
<lb xmlns=""/>he thought that a wife would be very convenient tohelp him
<lb xmlns=""/>spend it. He could not spend his salary before it was rais-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed, how then could he do so with so great an addition to it?
<lb xmlns=""/>By some accident his employers heard that their salesman
<lb xmlns=""/>was going to get married on a certain day, for Hubs could
<lb xmlns=""/>not brace up his nerves to announce the fact himself. He
<lb xmlns=""/>was fearful that they might not approve of so rash an under-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>taking, and he had not the courage to act contrary to their
<lb xmlns=""/>wishes. The night before the great day that was to see
<lb xmlns=""/>Hubs a married man, he called Mr. Hinks, the senior part-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ner, aside, with the intention of asking leave of absence for a
<lb xmlns=""/>week ; for the lady’s friends had planned out a wedding
<lb xmlns=""/>tour to the Springs, for Hubs and his bride. But Mr. Hinks,
<lb xmlns=""/>being fond of a joke when it was not played off at his own
<lb xmlns=""/>expense, and suspecting the nature of his salesman’s commu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>nication, did not give him time to open his mouth, but in-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>formed him that he must go into New Jersey the next morn-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ing by daybreak, to look after a delinquent customer. The
<lb xmlns=""/>terrified client looked as horror-struck at this announcement
<lb xmlns=""/>as he well could, and before he could gather together his as-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tonished senses, stammered out that he could not go.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Can’t go, sir!” exclaimed Mr. Hinks in a voice that was
<lb xmlns=""/>widely at variance with the expression of his face, as Hubs
<lb xmlns=""/>might have seen if he had looked at him. “But you must
<lb xmlns=""/>go, Mr. Hubs. Can’t go ! Bless my buttons, Mr. Hubs, I
<lb xmlns=""/>never heard such an expression before."
<lb xmlns=""/>“ I’m engaged to —to —" stammered Hubs.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Engaged to what, sir ?” said Mr. Hinks fiercely, “ engag-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed to what, sir? I had an idea that you were engaged to
<lb xmlns=""/>the firm of Hinks and Whipple, sir. Have we not raised
<lb xmlns=""/>your salary two hundred dollars, Mr. Hubs?”
<lb xmlns=""/>“ You have," replied Hubs, “ I have not forgotten it, and
<lb xmlns=""/>I never can; but I have got a little engagement on my hands
<lb xmlns=""/>which I cannot well put off, and I should be glad to have a
<lb xmlns=""/>Week’s liberty, if it be possible.”
<lb xmlns=""/>“ It is impossible, quite impossible,” replied the inveterate
<lb xmlns=""/>jobber, with great seriousness, "times are hard and business
<lb xmlns=""/>must not be neglected."
<lb xmlns=""/>Hubs was beginning to look most uncomfortably pale, and
<lb xmlns=""/>Mr. Hinks was afraid to carry ibe joke further.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Well, Mr. Hubs, since you must go,” said his employer,
<lb xmlns=""/>“I will despatch Mr. Putty, the book-keeper, into New Jersey,
<lb xmlns=""/>and here is a trifle to pay for your wedding suit.” Where-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>upon he handed Hubs a check for a hundred dollars and then
<lb xmlns=""/>broke loose into a most unjobber-like explosion of mirth, in
<lb xmlns=""/>which he was joined by Mr. Whipple and all the junior
<lb xmlns=""/>clerks who had been watching all the proceedings and dying
<lb xmlns=""/>for their employer to give them the cue, that they might
<lb xmlns=""/>laugh at poor Hubs, who was so overcome that he was forc-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed to walk off to some dark nook where he could give utter-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ance to a heart full of feelings, which had been gathering
<lb xmlns=""/>like water in a mill-dam after a sudden thaw.
<lb xmlns=""/>It would have been a difficult matter to decide whether
<lb xmlns=""/>Hubs or his employer went home with the lighter heart that
<lb xmlns=""/>night. There can be no doubt that, generally speaking, the
<lb xmlns=""/>giver of a gift is a happier person than the receiver ; and if
<lb xmlns=""/>men would but bear this fact in mind there can be as little
<lb xmlns=""/>doubt, that gifts would become more common than they are.
<lb xmlns=""/>Hubs made his appearance the next morning in Division
<lb xmlns=""/>street, in a white satin stock and a Marseilles vest: the mar-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>riage passed off without an accident, the tour was accom-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>plished, and time’s wheels rolled round as smoothly and as
<lb xmlns=""/>swiftly as though nothing remarkable had happened. In the
<lb xmlns=""/>first wild tumult of his feelings, Hubs made a silent vow
<lb xmlns=""/>that his first-born should be called, in honor of his employer,
<lb xmlns=""/>Hinks. But, two years had already flown by and he had
<lb xmlns=""/>not, for a very sufficient reason, performed his vow. His
<lb xmlns=""/>grateful feelings, however, had not diminished in the slight-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>est degree, and he wished for nothing so ardently as for an
<lb xmlns=""/>opportunity to manifest them. It is true that Hubs had at
<lb xmlns=""/>times wished that his employer had been in earnest about
<lb xmlns=""/>sending him into New Jersey to look after a delinquent cus-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tomer, or that something else had happened to prevent his
<lb xmlns=""/>marriage. Not that the matrimonial state was not all that
<lb xmlns=""/>he anticipated, but it proved to be a vast deal more ; but
<lb xmlns=""/>that was no fault of his employers.
<lb xmlns=""/>Hubs occupied a little frame house in the outskirts of the
<lb xmlns=""/>city, with a little dusty garden attached to it, containing a
<lb xmlns=""/>woful looking lilac bush and two very dirty poplars. He
<lb xmlns=""/>had selected this spot because he was growing dyspeptic
<lb xmlns=""/>and his physician had recommended a country residence;
<lb xmlns=""/>and had it not been for a tannery and glue factory in his im-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>mediate neighborhood it would have been quite delightful.
<lb xmlns=""/>Mr. Hinks had a remarkable excrescence on his right cheek,
<lb xmlns=""/>generally of an ashy color, but every autumn it assumed a
<lb xmlns=""/>very peculiar yellowish hue. People said that he was
<lb xmlns=""/>marked with a cantelupe. However that may be, it is cer-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tain that he was extravagantly fond of that kind of fruit, and
<lb xmlns=""/>while they lasted he hardly ate of anything but muskmelons.
<lb xmlns=""/>Hubs was well acquainted with his employer’s appetite,
<lb xmlns=""/>and he determined to raise some of the finest cantelupes in
<lb xmlns=""/>his little garden that the world had ever seen, and present
<lb xmlns=""/>them to him. It was a happy thought, and so completely
<lb xmlns=""/>took possession of his brain that he could think of nothing else.
<lb xmlns=""/>Even satinets became a weariness to him, It was before
<lb xmlns=""/>the frost was out of the ground that the idea occurred to him,
<lb xmlns=""/>and he could hardly wait for the sun to soften the soil so that
<lb xmlns=""/>he could begin to plant. But while he was waiting for the
<lb xmlns=""/>season to roll round, he read through half a dozen num-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>bers of the Farmer’s Almanac in search of agricultural
<lb xmlns=""/>knowledge. It had never occurred to him before that cante-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>lupes required any particular mode of culture. He thought,
<lb xmlns=""/>if he ever thought on the subject at all, that they grew
<lb xmlns=""/>spontaneously. He knew that they were always to be found
<lb xmlns=""/>in the market at a certain season of the year, but how they
<lb xmlns=""/>got there was a matter entirely beyond the circle of his
<lb xmlns=""/>thoughts. It was a thing of course, and that was all he
<lb xmlns=""/>knew about it. But his new course of study opened to him
<lb xmlns=""/>a world of pleasures. Every fact that he found out proved
<lb xmlns=""/>a new delight. Once he looked upon an acquaintance with
<lb xmlns=""/>the different qualities of satinets as the highest kind of know-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ledge but he now found turnips and cauliflowers a source
<lb xmlns=""/>of amusement and profit. The whole vegetable world was
<lb xmlns=""/>suddenly invested with most marvellous properties that excit-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed the utmost astonishment in his mind. He looked upon a
<lb xmlns=""/>potato with feelings bordering on veneration when he learn-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed that that humble vegetable was compounded of starch,
<lb xmlns=""/>water, albumen, sugar, poison fatty matter, parenchyma,
<lb xmlns=""/>malic acid and salts; and the knowledge that a simple little
<lb xmlns=""/>green weed, as soon as it thrusts its innocent head above the
<lb xmlns=""/>earth begins to imbibe carbonic acid and oxide of ammonia
<lb xmlns=""/>from the surrounding atmosphere, and that it produces hydro-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>gen, fixes azote and abstracts electricity, made him regard
<lb xmlns=""/>the grass beneath his feet with affection. He had no idea
<lb xmlns=""/>that there was such instinct in plants. The trees in the Park,
<lb xmlns=""/>the flowers in street windows, the vegetables in the market,
<lb xmlns=""/>and the fruits on street stalls, all attracted his attention, not
<lb xmlns=""/>as things of traffic or of nourishment, but as organized exis-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tences obeying the laws of their own being, and showing
<lb xmlns=""/>forth the glory and goodness of their Maker as plainly, and
<lb xmlns=""/>as abundantly as his own species. He wondered at his for-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>mer darkness, and he began to perceive what an abundance
<lb xmlns=""/>of lovable things there are in the world.
<lb xmlns=""/>     O what a blessing is knowledge! thought Mr. Hubs.
<lb xmlns=""/>How it enhances our delights, lessens our griefs, gives a rel-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>280

<lb xmlns=""/>ish to labor, makes even poverty cheerful, and takes from
<lb xmlns=""/>death itself more than half its terrors.
<lb xmlns=""/>His acquisitions of knowledge were very small indeed, and
<lb xmlns=""/>confined entirely to the manufacture of satinets and the cul-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ture of cantelupes, and yet such was the liberal effect of sci-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ence on his mind that he could have clasped the whole world
<lb xmlns=""/>to his heart if his wife had been out of it. His little insight
<lb xmlns=""/>into the mysteries of vegetable germination had given him
<lb xmlns=""/>a vague feeling of awe for his mother earth, although it was
<lb xmlns=""/>mainly as the great parent of cantelupes that he reverenced
<lb xmlns=""/>her, and he looked with growing impatience for the time to
<lb xmlns=""/>arrive when he should be permitted to scratch her back with
<lb xmlns=""/>his iron rake, and root up the weeds from her face as a pi-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ous child would pull the intrusive hairs from the chin of his
<lb xmlns=""/>grandmother.
<lb xmlns=""/>He had exhausted his almanacs, hut his thirst for know-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ledge had increased in proportion to his acquisitions, as a
<lb xmlns=""/>miser grows covetous as he grows rich, and he now supplied
<lb xmlns=""/>himself with a paper of seeds and Bridgman’s darling little
<lb xmlns=""/>Gardener’s Assistant at the same time, and took them home
<lb xmlns=""/>with the feelings of a philosopher. His wife scolded him
<lb xmlns=""/>smartly for his extravagance, but he bore all her womanly
<lb xmlns=""/>reproaches with the equanimity of a Socrates, and only re-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>plied to her long lecture, “wait and see.’’ That the reader
<lb xmlns=""/>may know to what extent Hubs carried his philosophy, we
<lb xmlns=""/>will give a short extract from one of his help-mate's exerci-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/> tations.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Goodness me ? What is that, a book ? A nasty book !
<lb xmlns=""/>Well, now we shall starve! Mother always said so. I
<lb xmlns=""/>never new a man worth anything who was always lazying
<lb xmlns=""/>away his time over books. Well, I see what my fate will
<lb xmlns=""/>be. I shall have to go home to my mother’s. I won’t work
<lb xmlns=""/>to support a loafer, not I. You had better have given me
<lb xmlns=""/>that money to buy a breast pin. I told you yesterday I
<lb xmlns=""/>wanted a brooch to put my brother’s hair in. You silly
<lb xmlns=""/>thing, what good will a book do you ? O, yes, I seem to see
<lb xmlns=""/>you.	Aint you going to set up for a literary character. O
<lb xmlns=""/>my!	I should n’t wonder. You told me yesterday you
<lb xmlns=""/>could’nt afford to go to the theatre, and there you have went
<lb xmlns=""/>and thrown away your money for a good-for-nothing book.
<lb xmlns=""/>But I’ll go to the theatre if I live, and to the museum too, and
<lb xmlns=""/>I’ll treat myself and my sister to ice creams and soda water
<lb xmlns=""/>at Thompson’s. See if I don’t. I never done such an ex-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>travagant thing as to buy a book, nor my mother before me.
<lb xmlns=""/>I have got that to be thankful for. Goodness me, no! I
<lb xmlns=""/>come from good respectable folks, who knew no more about
<lb xmlns=""/>books than the pope of Rome. But don’t leave your book in
<lb xmlns=""/>my reach, mister ; if you do, into the fire it goes, I can prom-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ise you.”
<lb xmlns=""/>Mr. Hubs’s two years of matrimonial trials had given him
<lb xmlns=""/>somewhat of an insight into the peculiarities of the female
<lb xmlns=""/>character, and he well knew the consequences of attempting
<lb xmlns=""/>to convince his wife that she had taken hold of the wrong
<lb xmlns=""/>of the question ; so he merely answered, “ wait and see,”
<lb xmlns=""/>and resolved to profit by her caution, and keep his precious
<lb xmlns=""/>little treatise under lock and key.
<lb xmlns=""/>His grounds only measured twenty five feet by forty, and
<lb xmlns=""/>as one portion of them was used as a grass plat for bleaching
<lb xmlns=""/>clothes, and a large slice was taken up by a gravel walk, it
<lb xmlns=""/>will readily be perceived that his garden could not be very
<lb xmlns=""/>extensive. But it was large enough for his desires, and he
<lb xmlns=""/>looked upon his little enclosure with the feelings of a land-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>holder. It is doubtful whether the rich Mr. Wadsworth,
<lb xmlns=""/>who owns half the Genessee flats, ever felt as grand as Mr.
<lb xmlns=""/>Hubs did when he first stuck his shovel into the ground to
<lb xmlns=""/>commence the cultivation of cantelupes.
<lb xmlns=""/>Ambition always will overleap its mark. Hubs planted
<lb xmlns=""/>his cantelupe seed at least a fortnight too soon, and they all 
<lb xmlns=""/>rotted in the ground. After waiting an unreasonable time
<lb xmlns=""/>to see the young vines show their little heads above ground
<lb xmlns=""/>he was obliged to rake open the hills and plant afresh. Ev-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ery morning he got up with the sun, and sometimes before,
<lb xmlns=""/>to watch his seeds, and see if they had burst from their dark
<lb xmlns=""/>hiding places ; and as the dews were copious and the sun
<lb xmlns=""/>warm, he soon had the delight of seeing their delicate leaves,
<lb xmlns=""/>like outspread hands, throw aside the earthy particles which
<lb xmlns=""/>covered them, and salute the uprising sun with a grateful
<lb xmlns=""/>smile, like a new born infant gazing into the face of its pa-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>rent. Surely never before did a tiller of the soil experience
<lb xmlns=""/>such delightful sensations as those which agitated the breast
<lb xmlns=""/>of Mr. Hubs on this occasion. He could not help running back
<lb xmlns=""/>to the bedside of his sleeping wife to beg that she would
<lb xmlns=""/>come down and look at his cantelupes. But his “ last best
<lb xmlns=""/>gift” did not relish his intrusion at such an unseasonable
<lb xmlns=""/>hour, and she turned upon him with a How of expressions
<lb xmlns=""/>that our respect for her sex will not permit us to repeat. He
<lb xmlns=""/>left her to sleep on, and when he took his seat in the omni-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>bus to go to his daily occupation of selling satinets, he felt
<lb xmlns=""/>like a new man. He tried to appear as humble as he could,
<lb xmlns=""/>but he experienced an uncomfortable feeling of superiority
<lb xmlns=""/>in spite of himself, which he had never felt before. All day
<lb xmlns=""/>his thoughts were wandering away to his cantelupes. He
<lb xmlns=""/>was impatient to get back to them. A long-winded custo-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>mer front Vermont detained him forever, as it appeared to
<lb xmlns=""/>him, just as he was about to leave the store, and it was al-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>most dark when he reached home. Before he would sit
<lb xmlns=""/>down to his supper, he rushed out to look at his young troop
<lb xmlns=""/>of vegetable earlings. But, alas! for human anticipations !
<lb xmlns=""/>The cantelupes had disappeared; vanished from mortal sight
<lb xmlns=""/>as though they had never been. The had been cruelly, bar-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>barously cut off in the morning of their existence. He could
<lb xmlns=""/>have wept over their loss, bnt tears would avail them noth-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ing. Their fate was shrouded in deep mystery. Nobody
<lb xmlns=""/>knew how it was done. Mrs. Hubs was profoundly ignorant
<lb xmlns=""/>of the matter, and Bridget was willing to take her Bible oath
<lb xmlns=""/>that she knew no more about the “ young millions” than the
<lb xmlns=""/>child unborn. Mr. Hubs, of course, could not compel peo-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ple to confess what they did not know, and he went to his bed
<lb xmlns=""/>in a state of miserable ignorance about the premature disap-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>pearance of his darling vegetables. But he had a horrible
<lb xmlns=""/>suspicion, which kept him awake half the night, that he was
<lb xmlns=""/>the victim of a wicked conspiracy between the wife of his bo-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>som and her servant-maid.
<lb xmlns=""/>He was not to be daunted, however, for he had been edu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cated in a school which knows no such word as despair.
<lb xmlns=""/>By dawn the next morning he was planting fresh seeds, hav-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ing put them to soak in warm lye over night. But Hubs
<lb xmlns=""/>was doomed once more to disappointment; he had not been
<lb xmlns=""/>seated five minutes in the omnibus when a scoundrel cock,
<lb xmlns=""/>belonging to a sporting neighbor, walked deliberately into
<lb xmlns=""/>the hall door, which had been left open by Bridget, and
<lb xmlns=""/>strutted pompously into the garden, where, without the
<lb xmlns=""/>slightest hesitation, he scratched up every individual seed,
<lb xmlns=""/>and when he had stowed them away in his remorseless maw
<lb xmlns=""/>gave three loud exulting “cock-a-doodle-doos,” and flew
<lb xmlns=""/>over the fence into his master’s premises. It was the cool-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>est performance that was ever seen, and when the unhappy
<lb xmlns=""/>clerk was told of it, his wrath was too big for words. He
<lb xmlns=""/>doubled his fists, stamped his feet, aud looked about him for
<lb xmlns=""/>some object upon which to wreak his vengeance ; but there
<lb xmlns=""/>was nothing appropriate at hand, so after a moment’s reflec-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tion he put more seeds in soak, and when he had eaten his
<lb xmlns=""/>supper retired to bed, that he might rise with the dawn.
<lb xmlns=""/>In due time, and it was a very short time too, for the sun
<lb xmlns=""/>was unseasonably hot, he had the happiness to see the little
<lb xmlns=""/>leaves once more popping up bright and joyous from the
<lb xmlns=""/>earth. He had watched them, and watered them an entire
<lb xmlns=""/>week, sprinkling snuff upon them to kill the bugs, and nip-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ping off the first indications of a runner bud, to strengthen the
<lb xmlns=""/>vines and give richness to the fruit, when his wife’s brother
<lb xmlns=""/>returned from a long voyage to the Pacific. He was one of
<lb xmlns=""/>the best-natured and most restless creatures in the world ;
<lb xmlns=""/>like the sea, he would not be quiet a moment, and after he
<lb xmlns=""/>had kissed his sister and joked her about her husband, he
<lb xmlns=""/>rolled out into the garden and, to make himself useful, took
<lb xmlns=""/>up Hubs’s hoe and began, to use his own phrase, “to work
<lb xmlns=""/>a traverse among the weeds.”
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Goodness me!” exclaimed his sister, “ what have you
<lb xmlns=""/>done! You have went and hoed up all of Mr. Hubs’s cante-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>lupes. My, what will he say when he comes home !”
<lb xmlns=""/>When Hubs did come home he was soon informed of the
<lb xmlns=""/>full extent of his misfortune, but he could not open his
<lb xmlns=""/>mouth. It was his wife’s brother who had done the deed,
<lb xmlns=""/>and wives’ brothers are always privileged characters. He
<lb xmlns=""/>knew moreover, that there was no malice in the act. He
<lb xmlns=""/>had the stomach to do anything that was monstrous, if it
<lb xmlns=""/>would bring back his vines, but as no desperate deed could
<lb xmlns=""/>restore them he had the prudence to eat his supper in a qui-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>et manner, although his mind was in a most unquiet state.
<lb xmlns=""/>The young sailor expressed a world of regret for the mis-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>chief he had done, and to console his brother-in-law, told
<lb xmlns=""/>him that he had got some first rate melon seeds in the till of
<lb xmlns=""/>his chest, which he had brought from round Cape Horn; and
<lb xmlns=""/>the next morning bright and early, he brought them up to
<lb xmlns=""/>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
<lb xmlns=""/>281
<lb xmlns=""/>Hubs, who was greatly astonished at the sight of them.
<lb xmlns=""/>They were as big as a dozen of those that he planted before.
<lb xmlns=""/>The young sailor took a fresh quid of tobacco, and told him
<lb xmlns=""/>that he would be more astonished at the fruit. Then they
<lb xmlns=""/>both went to work and made fresh hills, and felt once more
<lb xmlns=""/>happy at the prospect of beiag able to present his employer
<lb xmlns=""/>with some of his favorite fruit. In a week the new seeds
<lb xmlns=""/>showed themselves. Never before were such promising
<lb xmlns=""/>vines seen. They were so stout, and they grew so rapidly
<lb xmlns=""/>that Hubs was in a continual ecstasy of wonder ; but when
<lb xmlns=""/>he looked out of his chamber window one morning and saw
<lb xmlns=""/>a large yellow blossom on one of the vines his admiration
<lb xmlns=""/>was boundless. He ran down to examine it, and was half
<lb xmlns=""/>disposed to be angry when he found that it was nothing but
<lb xmlns=""/>a male blossom. The vine which bore it grew very rapidly
<lb xmlns=""/>in the direction of the garden fence, and Hubs watched it
<lb xmlns=""/>with great anxiety to see whether it would run its head
<lb xmlns=""/>against the obstruction like a foolish blind creature; and his
<lb xmlns=""/>delight was immense when he perceived that it only ap-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>proached within a safe distance, and then turned off to the
<lb xmlns=""/>right without rubbing a leaf against the palings. “ You are
<lb xmlns=""/>a fine fellow,” said Hubs, speaking to the vine, as though it
<lb xmlns=""/>had been furnished with a pair of ears like his own, “ You
<lb xmlns=""/>are a fine fellow; yes you are, and I will demolish that ras-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cal of a caterpillar that is eating one of your big leaves. The
<lb xmlns=""/>villain."
<lb xmlns=""/>The rains fell, the sun shone bright and warm upon it;
<lb xmlns=""/>the gentle summer winds rustled among its great summer
<lb xmlns=""/>blossoms and fan like leaves; the dews pearled it in the
<lb xmlns=""/>morning and the bees hovered about it all the day long, and
<lb xmlns=""/>still the vine grew, trailing its long rope-like body all over
<lb xmlns=""/>the garden, to the infinite wonder of all who looked upon it.
<lb xmlns=""/>At last a little knob of pale green showed itself in the ex-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>treme end of the vine, and gave promise of fruit. It was
<lb xmlns=""/>bailed with rapture by Mr. Hubs, and even his wife conde-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>scended to cast a favorable eye upon it, out of regard to her
<lb xmlns=""/>brother, as she said, but in reality because she was fond of
<lb xmlns=""/>melons herself, and because she had secretly resolved to in-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>vite all Division street to partake of it as soon as it should
<lb xmlns=""/>be ripe.
<lb xmlns=""/>Hubs was constantly in a high fever through fear that
<lb xmlns=""/>somebody would tread upon the vine, and he cautioned Brid-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>get, on pain of instant dismissal, to be cautious how she
<lb xmlns=""/>planted her big feet near it. The young melon promised to
<lb xmlns=""/>be a monster, it grew in the space of three days to the size
<lb xmlns=""/>of an apple dumpling, and Hubs put some dry leaves under
<lb xmlns=""/>it to keep it from decaying; although a slate would have
<lb xmlns=""/>been better, as he might have found out by reading Bosc.
<lb xmlns=""/>But his researches had not yet extended so far. Neither had
<lb xmlns=""/>he stumbled upon Jolyclerc or Linnæus. More was the pity,
<lb xmlns=""/>as the reader will discover.
<lb xmlns=""/>Hubs regarded the promising appearance of his cantelupe
<lb xmlns=""/>with some such feelings as a fond mother looks upon her
<lb xmlns=""/>precocious child, and sees in its premature wisdom a sign of
<lb xmlns=""/>premature decay. He dared not hope that so remarkable a
<lb xmlns=""/>melon would be permitted to arrive at perfection. It was
<lb xmlns=""/>too much to think of. And his forebodings were not with-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>out cause, for the phenomenon had not been in existence a
<lb xmlns=""/>fortnight when a hungry sow with a litter of pigs broke into
<lb xmlns=""/>the enclosure and devoured the precocious vegetable before a
<lb xmlns=""/>soul could come to its rescue.
<lb xmlns=""/>As the readers of romantic histories are often called upon
<lb xmlns=""/>to exercise their imaginations when the descriptive powers
<lb xmlns=""/>of the author fail him, they are respectfully requested to do
<lb xmlns=""/>so now, for no pen could begin to describe the anguish of
<lb xmlns=""/>mind which Mr. Hubs experienced when he was made ac-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>quainted with the disaster which had befallen him. He
<lb xmlns=""/>knew of no suitable manner of manifesting his feelings on
<lb xmlns=""/>the occasion ; it was a grief without a precedent; so he
<lb xmlns=""/>strolled into his garden in a bitter frame of mind, and began
<lb xmlns=""/>to kick pettishly at the vines and blossoms which now look-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed hateful to him. Soon he kicked over one of the great
<lb xmlns=""/>broad leaves, and underneath it he discovered another melon
<lb xmlns=""/>larger and fairer than the one that was lost. He clapped
<lb xmlns=""/>his hands with delight, and could hardly restrain himself
<lb xmlns=""/>from falling on his knees and saluting the precious ob-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ject.
<lb xmlns=""/>Every precaution was now taken to keep out hogs and
<lb xmlns=""/>boys and every kind of vermin. The new melon was watch-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed over with a degree of solicitude passing belief, and it grew
<lb xmlns=""/>to a size far surpassing any melon that had been seen or
<lb xmlns=""/>read of. Hubs knew that professor Alpin bad seen melons
<lb xmlns=""/>in Egypt so large that three of them were a load for a camel
<lb xmlns=""/>but they were water-melons, and this was a cantelupe.
<lb xmlns=""/>Hubs watered the roots of the vine with weak pickle, af-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ter the Honfleur fashion, to give richness to the fruit; and he
<lb xmlns=""/>covered the joints with earth in place of pinching off its run-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ner buds, to increase its size; for he had already learned
<lb xmlns=""/>enough about culture to make him reject the theory of the
<lb xmlns=""/>pinchers, and he argued (whether truly or not, we must leave
<lb xmlns=""/>others to decide,) that any mutilation of a plant must of ne-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cessity injure its organization. Who would think of chop-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ping off his son’s legs, said Hubs, with the expectation of in-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>creasing the length of his son’s arms thereby ?
<lb xmlns=""/>By the end of September, the melon had increased to such
<lb xmlns=""/>a size that Hubs could hardly lift it off the ground. It had
<lb xmlns=""/>begun to assume a rich buff color, nearly as bright as a ripe
<lb xmlns=""/>Havana orange, but it did not emit that rich delightful fra-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>grance that ripe cantelupes usually do. But Hubs was fear-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ful that it would decay, or that some accident might befall
<lb xmlns=""/>it if it were kept longer, and he determined to invite his em-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ployer to partake of it while he was sure of it. In truth, his
<lb xmlns=""/>determination was fixed from certain movements on the part
<lb xmlns=""/>of his wife having led him to believe that she meditated
<lb xmlns=""/>treating her Division street friends to a taste of it.
<lb xmlns=""/>A good opportunity having soon occurred, he asked Mr.
<lb xmlns=""/>Hinks to do him the favor to go home with him and partake
<lb xmlns=""/>of a remarkably fine cantelupe, which he had raised in his
<lb xmlns=""/>own garden. The mark on Mr. Hinks’s cheek turned yellow
<lb xmlns=""/>as Hubs spoke.
<lb xmlns=""/>“By all means,” replied Mr. Hinks, “but is it really a fine
<lb xmlns=""/>one, though, Hubs ?”
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Very," replied Hubs, who did not care to let out the
<lb xmlns=""/>whole truth, for he wished to enjoy his employer’s surprise.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Then I will go to-night,” said Mr. Hinks. “ But, have
<lb xmlns=""/>you got no more than one, Hubs ? you know that I am a coon
<lb xmlns=""/>at cantelupes.”
<lb xmlns=""/>“ I know it, sir,” replied Hubs, “ but it is a caution. Big
<lb xmlns=""/>enough to feed the corporation.”
<lb xmlns=""/>“First rate, I dare say,” said Mr. Hinks, and he winked
<lb xmlns=""/>his right eye knowingly, and smacked his lips, and the mark
<lb xmlns=""/>on his cheek glowed with a bright yellowish tinge.
<lb xmlns=""/>Hubs exulted inwardly, although he said nothing more in
<lb xmlns=""/>praise of his melon; he was burning with impatience to see
<lb xmlns=""/>the effect that the great reality would have upon his em-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ployer.
<lb xmlns=""/>As soon as business hours were over they got into an om-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>nibus, a very happy pair of individuals, and in proper time
<lb xmlns=""/>were landed in front of Mr. Hubs’s residence. Hubs would
<lb xmlns=""/>not allow Mr. Hinks to remain a moment in the house, but
<lb xmlns=""/>hurried him out into the garden to show him the miraculous
<lb xmlns=""/>cantelupe, lest he should doubt that it grew there.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ There it is, sir,” exclaimed Hubs, pointing to the mon-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ster, “ isn’t it a whaler?”
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Where ? where ?” said Mr. Hinks, gazing about.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Here, sir, here,” replied Hubs as he patted the huge veg-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>etable.
<lb xmlns=""/>"That!" ejaculated Mr. Hinks, with a very red face.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Just try and lift it, sir,” said Hubs, exultingly.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Hubs,” said Mr. Hinks seriously, while the mark on his
<lb xmlns=""/>face changed from a yellowish hue to an ashy paleness,
<lb xmlns=""/>"you impertinent rascal, are you making sport of me ?”
<lb xmlns=""/>     Hubs was paralyzed at the manner of his employer, and
<lb xmlns=""/>could not speak a word.
<lb xmlns=""/>     "I'll have satisfaction for this, sir," said Mr. Hinks, grow-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ing more and more indignant. “You invite me to your
<lb xmlns=""/>house to eat a Valparaiso pumpkin, do you, sir ?"
<lb xmlns=""/>    “ A Valparaiso pumpkin, sir !” gasped the terrified Hubs,
<lb xmlns=""/>and the truth at once flashed upon his mind. “ It was all
<lb xmlns=""/>owing to my wife’s brother. O, dear ! and I shall have no
<lb xmlns=""/>cantelupe after all!

<lb xmlns=""/>REVIEWS.
<lb xmlns=""/>Alnwick Castle, with other Poems. By Fitz-Greene Halleck. New
<lb xmlns=""/>York, Harper &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Brothers. 1845.
<lb xmlns=""/>The system of criticism which obtains among us, and which
<lb xmlns=""/>tries the productions of one American mind by those of ano-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ther, instead of comparing them with some immutable stan-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>dard, or with the best examples in the same kind with which
<lb xmlns=""/>other countries have supplied us, has done great injury to the
<lb xmlns=""/>282
<lb xmlns=""/>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
<lb xmlns=""/>cause of true Art in our Republic. It was our misfortune to
<lb xmlns=""/>be in too great a hurry to have a literature of our own. We
<lb xmlns=""/>had built up an army and navy: we must build up a litera-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ture. It was further unanimously resolved that we had a
<lb xmlns=""/>national literature; and a score or two of terrified Tompkin-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ses, who might otherwise have remained life-long the con-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tented anchorites of the poet’s corner in a village newspaper,
<lb xmlns=""/>were suddenly snatched up and set to bear the pitiless storm
<lb xmlns=""/>of foreign fun and criticism on the bald lop of our American
<lb xmlns=""/>Parnassus. Henceforth every new work was measured by
<lb xmlns=""/>the Tompkins yardstick ; and the “precision and elegance,”
<lb xmlns=""/>“ the refined dignity,” “ the exuberant humor” of Tompkins
<lb xmlns=""/>became proverbial. Under these favorable circumstances,
<lb xmlns=""/>the gentlemen thus ostracised from among their fellow citi-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>zens for their country’s fame, plucked up courage, and by
<lb xmlns=""/>dint of well-directed energy succeeded in founding what we
<lb xmlns=""/>may call the Tompkins dynasty of American literature. A
<lb xmlns=""/>court dress of a certain innocuous drab-color was established,
<lb xmlns=""/>and any author who was detected without this Tompkins
<lb xmlns=""/>uniform was forthwith arrested and thrown into a review, or
<lb xmlns=""/>set in the pillory of the newspapers. The heresy of origina-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>lity was everywhere industriously hunted out and crushed ;
<lb xmlns=""/>and independence of judgment in criticism was declared to
<lb xmlns=""/>be immoral, or, what was far worse, anti-Tompkinsian. If
<lb xmlns=""/>man, woman, or child, was unwilling to receive the opinion
<lb xmlns=""/>of a Tompkins, how great an insensibility did it display to
<lb xmlns=""/>the numerous privileges we enjoy !
<lb xmlns=""/>The truth is that we shall never have a literature until we
<lb xmlns=""/>become thoroughly persuaded that we have not yet done all
<lb xmlns=""/>that is needful to that end, and that it requires at least as
<lb xmlns=""/>much previous study and preparation to criticise a work of
<lb xmlns=""/>art as a steam engine. We must get over our cant of always
<lb xmlns=""/>speaking of certain of our authors and artists as if they filled
<lb xmlns=""/>up the majestic round of that circle which even Shakspeare
<lb xmlns=""/>did not touch at all points. We must no longer endeavor to
<lb xmlns=""/>measure anything really great by the rushlight criticism of
<lb xmlns=""/>the Tompkinses, but must look on it in the broad frank sun-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>shine of honest desire after Truth. We must get rid also of
<lb xmlns=""/>this unhealthy hankering after a National Literature. The
<lb xmlns=""/>best and most enduring literature is that which has no na-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tionality except of the heart,—that which is the same under
<lb xmlns=""/>all languages and under all skies. A poet’s inspiration has
<lb xmlns=""/>no more intimate connection with the country in which he
<lb xmlns=""/>chances to be bom, than with the village or the garret in
<lb xmlns=""/>which he may dwell. While yet a sojourner among our
<lb xmlns=""/>mists and shadows, he is made citizen of a higher country,
<lb xmlns=""/>whose language is an interpreter throughout the universe,
<lb xmlns=""/>and which has no words mean enough to express our paltry
<lb xmlns=""/>nationalities, nor indeed any thoughts but such as are primi-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tive and universal.
<lb xmlns=""/>The office of poet, then, is the highest to which any man.
<lb xmlns=""/>in these latter times, may aspire. The poet has taken the
<lb xmlns=""/>place of the prophet, and, without laying any claim to imme-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>diate inspiration, he yet, by force of seeing the heart of those
<lb xmlns=""/>mysteries whose shell only is visible to others, instructs and
<lb xmlns=""/>prophesies with an authority felt if not acknowledged. If
<lb xmlns=""/>his words inculcate no truth directly, yet, by their innate
<lb xmlns=""/>harmony with universal laws, and by the sweet domestic
<lb xmlns=""/>privilege with which they enter the heart without knocking,
<lb xmlns=""/>they clarify the conscience, and inspire us with an eagerness
<lb xmlns=""/>after truth, as would a lender or majestic landscape in out-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ward nature. Let no man then take up the lyre hastily or
<lb xmlns=""/>irreverently, still less let him make its chords answerable
<lb xmlns=""/>for a gross and vulgar music.
<lb xmlns=""/>In America we have been accustomed to confer the title
<lb xmlns=""/>of poet as if it were of no more value or import than a trum-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>pery “ Honorable” or “Excellency.” We have something
<lb xmlns=""/>like a thousand individuals in the country to whom the critics
<lb xmlns=""/>of the newspapers and magazines concede the name. But
<lb xmlns=""/>there are half a dozen who form a kind of inner circle, who
<lb xmlns=""/>already, though in the prime of life, enjoy all the advantages
<lb xmlns=""/>of a posthumous fame, and whose portraits smile with an
<lb xmlns=""/>embarrassed air opposite all the title-pages of selections from
<lb xmlns=""/>American poets. It is to these that our critics periodically
<lb xmlns=""/>challenge England to produce a parallel. It is these who are
<lb xmlns=""/>led out and exhibited when the intelligent foreigner inquires
<lb xmlns=""/>after our poets—honest, matter-of-fact-looking men, as the
<lb xmlns=""/>poets of a business people ought to be.
<lb xmlns=""/>Mr. Halleck has had the ill fortune to be one of these fron-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tispiecial exemplars. We call it ill fortune, for it is as un-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>happy a thing for a man to receive more as to receive less
<lb xmlns=""/>than his deserts. But in speaking of Mr. Halleck we shall
<lb xmlns=""/>treat him as if he were a young author now for the first time
<lb xmlns=""/>making his appearance before the world. What his reputa-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tion has been is nothing to us: what it ought to be is the on-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ly question. To have been always considered and treated as
<lb xmlns=""/>one of Fame’s joint-heirs, and then to find that Fame has cut
<lb xmlns=""/>one off with a shilling, is worse than to have known the truth
<lb xmlns=""/>from the beginning.
<lb xmlns=""/>If the volume before us, then, were the work of a young
<lb xmlns=""/>author, (and we should remember that in this case the real
<lb xmlns=""/>age of Mr. H. renders all faults less inexcusable,) is there
<lb xmlns=""/>anything in it that would lead us to prophesy great things of
<lb xmlns=""/>his future career? To this question we must frankly and
<lb xmlns=""/>readily answer, no. There is none of that exuberance here,
<lb xmlns=""/>that seeming waste of energy, which characterises the spring-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tide of a great poet’s heart, of whose innumerable blossoms
<lb xmlns=""/>few will ever become anything more useful than an orna-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ment and token of immortal plenty. Here is none of that fe-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>licitous sympathy of ear and eye which gives every word and
<lb xmlns=""/>image and harmonic invention of his as good a right to be in
<lb xmlns=""/>the world, as any blossom or bird or sigh of the wind can
<lb xmlns=""/>have. Here is none of that fine reverence which overhangs
<lb xmlns=""/>his heart like the broad free sky, now bare, simple, sustain-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ing, now sprinkled thick with starry hopes and aspirations,
<lb xmlns=""/>and always the bestower of dignity, courage, and the calm
<lb xmlns=""/>majesty of entire humbleness. Here is none of that enthusi-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>asm for his art which makes success but an argument for
<lb xmlns=""/>less self-glory, and which turns a whole unbelieving world’s
<lb xmlns=""/>scorn into a stepping-stone to a higher peak of inspiration.
<lb xmlns=""/>The world is indebted to the volume before us for no new
<lb xmlns=""/>thought, for the opening of no new vista into the enchanted
<lb xmlns=""/>forest of imagination, for no new combination of the won-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>drous melody of words. There is none of that inspiration
<lb xmlns=""/>here, none of that magnetic sympathy of genius which could
<lb xmlns=""/>solve for the young poet the enigma of his soul, and waken
<lb xmlns=""/>the slumbering energies of heart and brain and will, till the
<lb xmlns=""/>grand images and harmonics of the master fade away, and
<lb xmlns=""/>he beholds only the great void future like a silent organ
<lb xmlns=""/>waiting but for the appointed touch to breathe divinest mu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>sic and ravish the reluctant world with love and pity. But
<lb xmlns=""/>even in some of the yet coarser elements of a true poet, Mr.
<lb xmlns=""/>Halleck is deficient. To the simpler and more vivacious
<lb xmlns=""/>kinds of metre, which depend rather on a certain gross and
<lb xmlns=""/>physical excitement of the musical sense, his ear is compe-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tent; but he seems to lack comprehension of these whose
<lb xmlns=""/>meaning is more interior, and whose charm is due to remoter
<lb xmlns=""/>and less tangible sympathies. What ingenuity, for example,
<lb xmlns=""/>could make anything like rhythm of such incorrigible, cordu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>roy joltings as these:
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Even of Campbell’s pen bath pictured: he.—
<lb xmlns=""/>“ To be o’erpraised even by her worshipper—Poesy” ?
<lb xmlns=""/>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
<lb xmlns=""/>283
<lb xmlns=""/>Love has been so reverenced by true poets, and woman so
<lb xmlns=""/>worthily praised, that a poet’s treatment of either of these
<lb xmlns=""/>hallowed subjects might almost be taken as a test of his pow-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>er. Andromache and she
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Whose face did launch a thousand ships”
<lb xmlns=""/>give bloom and fragrance to the Iliad. Beatrice hangs like
<lb xmlns=""/>a quiet star over the sulphureous pit of Dante’s Hell, glides
<lb xmlns=""/>with a calming sereneness through his Purgatory, and is the
<lb xmlns=""/>heavenliest part of his Paradise. How unequalled are Shaks-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>peare’s pictures of women ! Playful, whimsical, coquettish,
<lb xmlns=""/>sarcastic, yet never merely ornamental, and rounded off al-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ways with tender reverence and a pathos that gives them a
<lb xmlns=""/>noble dignity. And who will ever forget (to name no others)
<lb xmlns=""/>Wordsworth’s “ Phantom of Delight” and Coleridge’s “ Ge-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>nevieve” ? Mr. Halleck, with all the experience of fifty years
<lb xmlns=""/>in his head and heart, is content to put forth the following
<lb xmlns=""/>verses as containing his theory of love, but at the same time,
<lb xmlns=""/>to prevent any ill effect upon the mind of a susceptible pub-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>lic, he neutralises his nonsense by an equal amount of in-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>comprehensibility. In the first two stanzas the poet’s mind
<lb xmlns=""/>takes a horticultural turn, and beholds love in the original
<lb xmlns=""/>and novel shape of a tree :
<lb xmlns=""/>“ When the tree of Love is budding first,
<lb xmlns=""/>Ere yet its leaves are green,
<lb xmlns=""/>Ere yet, by shower ami sunbeam nursed,
<lb xmlns=""/>No infant life has been,
<lb xmlns=""/>The wild bee’s slightest touch might wring
<lb xmlns=""/>The buds from off the tree”—
<lb xmlns=""/>Love, it will be seen, makes but an indifferent kind of tree
<lb xmlns=""/>and puts forth buds of most singular, though convenient fra-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>gility.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ But when its open leaves have found
<lb xmlns=""/>A home in the free air,
<lb xmlns=""/>Pluck them—and there remains a wound
<lb xmlns=""/>That ever rankles there.”
<lb xmlns=""/>Where ? why?
<lb xmlns=""/>“ The blight of hope and happiness
<lb xmlns=""/>Is felt when fond ones part.
<lb xmlns=""/>And the bitter tear that follows is
<lb xmlns=""/>The life-blood of the heart.”
<lb xmlns=""/>A statement with regard to arterial circulation that would
<lb xmlns=""/>make Hervey open his eyes.—But “ the tree of Love” is cut
<lb xmlns=""/>down in the next stanza to make a fire of.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ When the flame of Love is kindled first,
<lb xmlns=""/>’Tis the fire-fly’s light at even—
<lb xmlns=""/>•	•	•	•
<lb xmlns=""/>A breath can bid it bum no more.”
<lb xmlns=""/>Flatly contradicted by the experience of every unbreeched
<lb xmlns=""/>philosopher who has exercised his lungs in endeavoring to
<lb xmlns=""/>blow a fire-fly into a flame. Mr. H. seems to think the suc-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cess of such an experiment possible.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ But when that flame has blazed into
<lb xmlns=""/>A being and a power,
<lb xmlns=""/>And smiled in scorn upon the dew
<lb xmlns=""/>That fell in its first warm hour.”
<lb xmlns=""/>We were rather puzzled at first to think with what particu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>lar muscles a “ flame" would “ smile”, but we had neglected
<lb xmlns=""/>to observe that it had “ blazed into a being.” Mr. Espy’s
<lb xmlns=""/>theory of rain is hinted at in the third verse, we suppose, or
<lb xmlns=""/>else what has the dew to do with it ? We should like also
<lb xmlns=""/>to know which “hour” of a flame is not “ warm.” We must
<lb xmlns=""/>not be surprised to find that a flame which has already been
<lb xmlns=""/>a tree and has accomplished the difficult disdain of a “ smile
<lb xmlns=""/>in scorn”, should become two things at once in the next
<lb xmlns=""/>stanza.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ ’Tis the flame that curls round the martyr’s head,”—
<lb xmlns=""/>Our sympathies, then, for Latimer, and Huss, and the rest,
<lb xmlns=""/>have been strangely misplaced.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Whose task is to destroy,
<lb xmlns=""/>’Tis the lamps on the altars of the dead,
<lb xmlns=""/>Whose light but darkens joy.”
<lb xmlns=""/>The next stanza is wholly incomprehensible:
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Then crush even in their hour of birth,
<lb xmlns=""/>The infant buds of love,
<lb xmlns=""/>And tread his glowing fire to earth,
<lb xmlns=""/>’Ere ’tis dark in clouds above ;
<lb xmlns=""/>Cherish no more a cypress tree
<lb xmlns=""/>To shade thy future years,
<lb xmlns=""/>Nor nurse a heart-flame that may be
<lb xmlns=""/>Quenched only with thy tears.”
<lb xmlns=""/>In the next line a girl’s Leghorn hat is said to be
<lb xmlns=""/>.... Of the bright gold tint
<lb xmlns=""/>The setting sunbeams give to Autumn clouds,
<lb xmlns=""/>The riband that encircled it as blue
<lb xmlns=""/>As spots of sky upon a moonless night
<lb xmlns=""/>When stars are keeping revelry in heaven."
<lb xmlns=""/>We shall expect to hear shortly of Jupiter being put into
<lb xmlns=""/>some celestial watch-house, or Mars relating his “experi-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ence” in a Temperance meeting.
<lb xmlns=""/>The same young woman’s waist, the poet tells us, might
<lb xmlns=""/>be “spanned with your thumb and finger”, and
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Her foot was loveliest of remembered things” !
<lb xmlns=""/>.......................................
<lb xmlns=""/>“ But ’twas that foot that broke the spell—alas !
<lb xmlns=""/>Its stocking had a deep, deep tinge of blue—
<lb xmlns=""/>I turned away in sadness and passed on.”
<lb xmlns=""/>It is possible that Mr. Halleck may have the hardihood to
<lb xmlns=""/>defend this on the ground of its being humorous. And we
<lb xmlns=""/>suppose that the next poem is humorous also. If it be, we
<lb xmlns=""/>are sincerely glad, for it is surely nothing else. We shall
<lb xmlns=""/>not take the trouble to prove that humorous poetry, even
<lb xmlns=""/>where the humor is genuine, is the lowest kind of poetry, if,
<lb xmlns=""/>indeed, it can be rightly called so at all. In Mr. Halleck’s
<lb xmlns=""/>verses the “ humor” comes in very incongruously, and gives
<lb xmlns=""/>all our expectations a neck-breaking jolt.
<lb xmlns=""/>There is a great deal of traditional morality and of entirely
<lb xmlns=""/>false sentiment in Mr. H.’s verses. For example, “Aln-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>wick Castle” he says
<lb xmlns=""/>“ The Moslem tramples on the Greek,
<lb xmlns=""/>And on the Cross and altar stone,
<lb xmlns=""/>And Christendom looks tamely on,
<lb xmlns=""/>• • • •
<lb xmlns=""/>And not a sabre blow is given
<lb xmlns=""/>For Greece and fame, for faith and heaven,
<lb xmlns=""/>By Europe’s craven chivalry.”
<lb xmlns=""/>When “faith and heaven” require to be defended by “sabre
<lb xmlns=""/>blows” and bloodshed, they must have sadly degenerated
<lb xmlns=""/>from what they were in Christ’s time.
<lb xmlns=""/>In the same poem Mr. H. laments that the day of romance
<lb xmlns=""/>has gone by, a statement which he sustains by telling us
<lb xmlns=""/>that the Highlanders of Scotland wear pantaloons, and that
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Lord Stafford mines for coal and salt,
<lb xmlns=""/>The Duke of Norfolk deals in malt,
<lb xmlns=""/>The Douglas in red herrings”—
<lb xmlns=""/>four facts which all the shopkeepers in New York will con-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>sider extremely ludicrous, as a matter of course, without
<lb xmlns=""/>thinking for a moment that all these peers are much more
<lb xmlns=""/>creditably employed than any of their ruffian ancestors ever
<lb xmlns=""/>were. Moreover, there is more that is truly poetical in the
<lb xmlns=""/>operations connected with mining, the raising of malt, and
<lb xmlns=""/>the herring fishery, than in all the “ chivalry” that ever went
<lb xmlns=""/>about breaking the heads of peaceable neighbours and the
<lb xmlns=""/>hearts of their wives and children. The man who thinks
<lb xmlns=""/>that the age of romance has gone by to-day, would have
<lb xmlns=""/>thought the same in Spenser’s time. Poetry is as rife in the
<lb xmlns=""/>world as ever, but the secret of it lies in the heart and eye
<lb xmlns=""/>and ear of the poet, not in any combination of circumstances.

<lb xmlns=""/>CRITICAL NOTICES.
<lb xmlns=""/>The Prisoners of Perote ; containing a Journal kept by the Author, who was
<lb xmlns=""/>captured by the Mexicans, at Mier, December 25, 1842, and released from
<lb xmlns=""/>Perote May 16, 1844. By William Preston Snapp. New York: Burgess,
<lb xmlns=""/>Stringer &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Co.
<lb xmlns=""/>This is a book at all points entertaining, and now and then imbued
<lb xmlns=""/>with a vivid and terrible interest. We quote some instances of Mex-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ican vagrancy and audacity:—if these things were not known to be
<lb xmlns=""/>fact, we should speak of them as capital romance :
<lb xmlns=""/>"Among the numerous wretches who, as professional beggars,
<lb xmlns=""/>swarm the streets of this city, or in the filthy guise of blackened lepe-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ros, haunt the pavé by day, and prowl for plunder at night, are out.
<lb xmlns=""/>casts and cut-throats, whom previous convictions have deadened to
<lb xmlns=""/>all sense of shame, and habitual vice and indolence trained to every
<lb xmlns=""/>deed of violence. In the portals of the churches, beneath the walls
<lb xmlns=""/>of the convents, in the markets, or their lairs in the suburbs, they
<lb xmlns=""/>crouch to watch tor their unsuspecting prey, and wo to that unarmed
<lb xmlns=""/>pedestrian, who, in reply to their Por el amor de Dios, reveals a purse
<lb xmlns=""/>to tempt their ferocious cupidity.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Banded in fraternities, that reach from the pulque shops to the
<lb xmlns=""/>palace, their organization has been known to reveal itself through ev-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ery grade of rank, from the roofless footpad to those nearest in author-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ity to the president. An instance of audacity is authentically related
<lb xmlns=""/>to have occurred some years ago, which not unaptly illustrates the
<lb xmlns=""/>lawless spirit of these plunderers. The mules of a conducta were
<lb xmlns=""/>ranged in two tiles in the square of the Adouana (or custom-house),
<lb xmlns=""/>and, surrounded by a strong squadron of cavalry, waited to be
<lb xmlns=""/>loaded with the bags of specie, containing fifteen hundred dollars each,
<lb xmlns=""/>and piled up in the square to be sent off. A large crowd was as usual
<lb xmlns=""/>assembled to look on, when a gang of mounted thieves charged through
<lb xmlns=""/>the streets leading to the square, and riding down idlers and troops,
<lb xmlns=""/>seized each a bag of the treasure, and bore it off in triumph.
<lb xmlns=""/>"The energy of the present government has done much to reduce
<lb xmlns=""/>the frequency and insolence of these outrages about the capital, yet
<lb xmlns=""/>they continue to prevail in all their won led atrocity elsewhere through
<lb xmlns=""/>the republic. Not a league of their only national highway from the
<lb xmlns=""/>city to Vera Cruz, but is the scene of some robbery within the year,
<lb xmlns=""/>the public coach being repeatedly pillaged within hail of the cities
<lb xmlns=""/>that lie on the route.
<lb xmlns=""/>"The following notorious instance of a participation in these enor-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>mities by persons of rank, is familiar to all persons of inquiry who
<lb xmlns=""/>have recently been in Mexico.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ The Swiss consul, (M. Mairet,) a merchant and man of fortune,
<lb xmlns=""/>lived in the western suburbs of the city, and was suspected to have a
<lb xmlns=""/>considerable sum of money about his house. His dwelling was more
<lb xmlns=""/>than ordinarily secure, being built in the strongest manner, with grat-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed windows, and several ferocious dogs were kept chained in the court
<lb xmlns=""/>and on the terrace.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ A man in the habit of a priest, accompanied by two others, appear-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed at his gate one day, and announced to the servant, who answered
<lb xmlns=""/>their summons, that they desired to purchase some merchandise of
<lb xmlns=""/>the consul, in which he was known to deal. Upon being admitted,
<lb xmlns=""/>two of them seized the servant, bound him to a pillar, and gagged
<lb xmlns=""/>him, whilst the third relocked the gate. All three then passed into
<lb xmlns=""/>the house, where they found Mairet alone, and after stabbing and
<lb xmlns=""/>gashing him repeatedly, finally compelled him to disclose the place
<lb xmlns=""/>where his treasure was secreted. This, to the amount of some
<lb xmlns=""/>ten thousand dollars, with various articles of valuable plate, they
<lb xmlns=""/>brought off; the consul only surviving his wounds long enough to re-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>late the particulars of the affair, with such descriptions of the assas-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>sins, as it was thought would lead to their apprehension. A noisy
<lb xmlns=""/>search and pursuit was kept up by the police, until a miserable crea-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ture was arrested, tried, and garroted, upon the ground of some dec-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>larations said to have fallen from him whilst grossly intoxicated. No
<lb xmlns=""/>money or article of the plunder being found in his possession, nor
<lb xmlns=""/>any corroborative circumstance accompanying his insane confession
<lb xmlns=""/>the foreigners denounced the execution as a cowardly subterfuge of
<lb xmlns=""/>the government to atone for its corruption and remissness by a double
<lb xmlns=""/>murder.
<lb xmlns=""/>“Some lime elapsed, when two daring robberies were again perpe-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>trated in rapid succession upon wealthy monasteries of the city.
<lb xmlns=""/>These were entered and pillaged of more than thirty thousand dollars,
<lb xmlns=""/>and the church being roused and combined in the pursuit with the civ-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>il authorities, finally traced them home to the door of Colonel Janes,
<lb xmlns=""/>an officer of standing, and acting aid-de-camp of Santa Anna. This
<lb xmlns=""/>worthy colonel, having access to the passport office, was more than
<lb xmlns=""/>suspected of having planned several previous robberies of the public
<lb xmlns=""/>coach, availing himself of the information thus acquired to direct his
<lb xmlns=""/>accomplices where the booty was such as to indemnify an attack.
<lb xmlns=""/>"The trial of himself and his associates for the pillage of the mon-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>nasteries lasted nearly three years, every effort being made during
<lb xmlns=""/>this time by Santa Anna and other officials, to screen him from con-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>viction. Their attempts, however, proving abortive, and sentence of
<lb xmlns=""/>death being finally awarded against him, it fell to the lot of the dicta-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tor, who had, in the meanwhile, risen to the presidency, to ratify the
<lb xmlns=""/>verdict, and order his execution. This he declined to do upon one
<lb xmlns=""/>pretext and another, granting the condemned respite after respite,
<lb xmlns=""/>until popular indignation became exasperated to the highest pitch.
<lb xmlns=""/>Dreading the fury bis equivocal course had excited in the public mind,
<lb xmlns=""/>and alarmed by threats of a revolutionary character, Santa Anna re-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tired from the city, and left the task of consummating the vengeance of
<lb xmlns=""/>the law to General Bravo.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Janes was finally executed, and, before suffering, confessed his nu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>merous crimes. Amongst these was the murder of Mairet, in which,
<lb xmlns=""/>as in all, he plead the connivance of Santa Anna, and other accompli-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ces. He died, invoking the most direful curses upon their heads, for
<lb xmlns=""/>abandoning him and concurring in his death.”
<lb xmlns=""/>In justice to Mr. Brantz Mayer, the author of “ Mexico as it Was
<lb xmlns=""/>and Is,” we must say that the “ New York Mirror” has lately point-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed out some very remarkable plagiarisms from Mr. M.’s book, perpe-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>trated by Mr. Snapp.
<lb xmlns=""/>Remarkt on an Address delivered before the New England Society of the City of
<lb xmlns=""/>New York, December 23, 1844, by George P. Marsh. Boston: C. Stimp-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>son.
<lb xmlns=""/>The manner of writing and punctuating the title-page of this pamph-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>let, is every thing. The remarks are certainly not by George P. Marsh.
<lb xmlns=""/>They are by some person anonymous, and are levelled against Mr. M
<lb xmlns=""/>—a point which it is just as well to understand. The treatise is pun-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>gently written, but we disagree with it throughout in its estimate of
<lb xmlns=""/>Mr. Marsh’s eloquence. The floridity which is objectionable in a
<lb xmlns=""/>written book, is not unfrequently a merit in an oration. In this case
<lb xmlns=""/>we can easily conceive not only that Mr. Marsh’s oratory was enthu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>siastically received, but that it was skilfully planned for the purpose
<lb xmlns=""/>of ensuring an enthusiastic reception.
<lb xmlns=""/>Table-Talk. By William Hazlitt. Part 1. No. 6 of Wiley and Putnam’s Li-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>brary of Choice Reading, pp. 200. Price 37 1-2 cts.
<lb xmlns=""/>This is a reprint of the two volumes published in Paris by Galignani,
<lb xmlns=""/>under the author’s own supervision, the essays having been selected
<lb xmlns=""/>from the four volumes published by himself in London. The second
<lb xmlns=""/>part will comprise the essays which the author would probably have
<lb xmlns=""/>included in another series which he intended to publish in Paris. It
<lb xmlns=""/>would be hardly a remove from sheer impertinence to recommend the
<lb xmlns=""/>essays of Hazlitt to ordinary readers ; he has been more universally
<lb xmlns=""/>read in this country than any other English essayist, if we except Ma-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>caulay. His egotism, though as obtrusive as Cobbett’s, is one of the
<lb xmlns=""/>charms of his style, for it is only the egotism of a dunce that is often
<lb xmlns=""/>sive. The two first essays in this volume, on the pleasure of painting,
<lb xmlns=""/>we would recommend to the consideration of all young artists who
<lb xmlns=""/>have not been abroad. The author had made very satisfactory pro-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>gress in the art when he went to the Louvre while it contained the
<lb xmlns=""/>fruits of Napoleon’s conquests in Italy, and he abandoned his easel.
<lb xmlns=""/>He saw a variety of excellence that he felt himself unable ever to
<lb xmlns=""/>equal, and he gave up painting in despair. Yet he had, unquestiona-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>bly, the genius of a painter, and his writings on art are among the
<lb xmlns=""/>most valuable of his productions. His principles may be safely trust-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed, but his criticisms on pictures must be taken with many grains of
<lb xmlns=""/>allowance for his enthusiasm. He could see charms in a picture which
<lb xmlns=""/>no one else could discover, and as bis criticisms were generally based
<lb xmlns=""/>upon recollections, he sometimes attributed qualities and features to a
<lb xmlns=""/>work which on inspection it was found to lack. The essay in this col-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>lection on a picture by Nicolas Poussin would lead a novice to expect
<lb xmlns=""/>qualities in a landscape which no work of art can ever possess. The
<lb xmlns=""/>critic attributes to the work itself the sublime ideas which it suggested
<lb xmlns=""/>to his mind, but which the painter himself probably never knew
<lb xmlns=""/>But the essay in the collection from which most practical good may-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>be gained is that on the ignorance of the learned. It is just the thing
<lb xmlns=""/>to take the starch out of a pedant and a book-worm, and we would
<lb xmlns=""/>recommend it to the sensible ignorant for their consolation.
<lb xmlns=""/>American Facts. Notes and Statistics relative to the government, resources,
<lb xmlns=""/>engagements, &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;c. of the United States of America. By George
<lb xmlns=""/>Palmer Putnam, member of the New York Historical Society ; Hon. Mem.
<lb xmlns=""/>of the Connecticut Hist. Soc., Hon. Secretary of the American Art-Union ;
<lb xmlns=""/>Author of an introduction to history, &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;c. With portraits and a map.
<lb xmlns=""/>London and New York. Wiley and Putnam.
<lb xmlns=""/>A handsome volume of nearly three hundred pages, containing a large
<lb xmlns=""/>amount of statistics, well calculated to enlighten English readers in
<lb xmlns=""/>respect to this country. We cannot understand the motive of the
<lb xmlns=""/>author in affixing to a work of this kind such a ponderous joke
<lb xmlns=""/>as the absurd review of British poets which appeared in the
<lb xmlns=""/>North American Review a year ago. It cannot surely help the sale
<lb xmlns=""/>of the book in London, and it will hardly have the effect of soothing
<lb xmlns=""/>any of the harsh feelings which may be still entertained by English
<lb xmlns=""/>writers towards American authors, or the American people at large.
<lb xmlns=""/>It is attaching too much importance to the paltry jealousy or ill na-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ture of an anonymous scribbler to make his niaseries the subject of na-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tional recriminations. The portraits are chiefly valuable as being im-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>pressions from plates produced by the nearly discovered process of
<lb xmlns=""/>multiplying prints.	_______
<lb xmlns=""/>Count Ludwig, and other romances. By Charles Dickens, with stories by
<lb xmlns=""/>Jerrold, Moore, Ainsworth, and Allan Cunningham. Now first collected
<lb xmlns=""/>into a single vol. H. G. Daggers, 30 Ann st. Price 25 cts.
<lb xmlns=""/>Count Ludwig is one of the most remarkable of its author’s produc-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tions, as containing not the slightest evidence of his peculiar and bril-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>liant genius. The changes of an author’s style forms a curious chapter
<lb xmlns=""/>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
<lb xmlns=""/>285
<lb xmlns=""/>in the history of literature, and the study of Count Ludwig in contrast
<lb xmlns=""/>with the other writings of Boz, is an interesting subject for the
<lb xmlns=""/>critic.
<lb xmlns=""/>The Apochryphal New Testament, containing all the Gospels, Epistles, and
<lb xmlns=""/>other pieces, not included in the New Testament, by its compilers. Trans-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>lated and now first collected into one volume. New York. Published by
<lb xmlns=""/>H.	G. Daggers, 30 Ann st.
<lb xmlns=""/>The importance of this publication to all Bible students may be in-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ferred from the following passage in the translator's preface to the
<lb xmlns=""/>second English edition.
<lb xmlns=""/>“ By some persons of the multitude commonly known by the name
<lb xmlns=""/>of Christians, and who profess to suppose they do God service by call-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ing themselves so, the editor has been assailed with a malignity and
<lb xmlns=""/>fury that would have graced the age of Elizabeth and Mary.”
<lb xmlns=""/>The volume is handsomely printed on good paper in a shape uniform
<lb xmlns=""/>with the ordinary editions of the genuine New Testament.
<lb xmlns=""/>History of Germany, from the earliest period to the present time. By Frede-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>rick Kohlrausch translated from the last German edition, by James D.
<lb xmlns=""/>Haas. Appleton and Co., 200 Broadway. Part 2d, 25 cts.
<lb xmlns=""/>The present number of this admirable history reaches to the middle
<lb xmlns=""/>of the fourteenth century. The work will be complete in three more
<lb xmlns=""/>numbers, and will form a most valuable and much needed addition to
<lb xmlns=""/>historical libraries.
<lb xmlns=""/>Specimens of Ancient Oracular and Fighting Eolipiles : with remarks on Dra-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>gons and other fire breathing monsters of mythology and the middle ages,
<lb xmlns=""/>being a supplement to his treatise on hydraulics and mechanics; by Tho-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>mas Ewbank. New York. Published by the Author. 1845.
<lb xmlns=""/>This supplement to the large work on Hydraulics, by Mr. Ewbank,
<lb xmlns=""/>will render that treatise the most learned and perfect one on that
<lb xmlns=""/>branch of science in existence. Mr. Ewbank is a double enthusiast,
<lb xmlns=""/>for he seems to have given as much thought and research to the mor-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>al demons and dragons of antiquity as to those of metal, wood and
<lb xmlns=""/>stone.
<lb xmlns=""/>THE MAGAZINES.
<lb xmlns=""/>The Aristidean.—The April, or second number of the Aristidean,
<lb xmlns=""/>is a decided improvement on the first. Some of the papers are exceed-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ingly good—precisely what Magazine papers should be—vigorous,
<lb xmlns=""/>terse, and independent. “ Travels in Texas” is very interesting.
<lb xmlns=""/>"Richard Parker’s Widow” is also admirable; and "Hans Spiegen”
<lb xmlns=""/>is quite in the Blackwood vein. There is a long review or rather run-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ning commentary upon Longfellow’s poems. It is, perhaps, a little
<lb xmlns=""/>coarse, but we are not disposed to call it unjust; although there are
<lb xmlns=""/>in it some opinions which, by implication, are attributed to ourselves
<lb xmlns=""/>individually, and with which we cannot altogether coincide. "Shood
<lb xmlns=""/>Swing is queer, and the "Notes about Men of Note” are amusing. Of
<lb xmlns=""/>the political papers we shall not speak. There is not much verse in
<lb xmlns=""/>the number, but some of it is admirable. "The Necessity of Stran-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>gling” is worthy of Hood, and "The Hanging of Polly Bodine” is
<lb xmlns=""/>perhaps a better thing in the same way. To show how high an opi-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>nion we entertain of the lines with the wretched title of "A Heart-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>Burst,” we will take the liberty of purloining them in full. They are,
<lb xmlns=""/>we think, the composition of the editor, Mr. English, and it is many a
<lb xmlns=""/>long day since we have seen anything so truly beautiful—in its pecu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>liar mode of beauty:
<lb xmlns=""/>Fill me no cup of Xeres' wine to her my heart holds dear;
<lb xmlns=""/>If you insist to pledge with me, then drop a silent tear.
<lb xmlns=""/>For she I love is far away, and months must pass before
<lb xmlns=""/>Her heart shall leap to hear again my foot-tramp at the door.
<lb xmlns=""/>And thus apart, my weary heart, torn both with hopes and fears,
<lb xmlns=""/>Gives to my spirit wretchedness, and to my eyelids tears.
<lb xmlns=""/>You laugh and quaff your Xeres’ wine around the festive board,
<lb xmlns=""/>And jest with names of those you love, which secret you should hoard;
<lb xmlns=""/>And I conceal how much I feel, for words could not express
<lb xmlns=""/>The sorrow weeping in my heart, the abject wretchedness,
<lb xmlns=""/>Illumined by a single hope—God grant it not in vain!—
<lb xmlns=""/>That foes may cease to part our hearts, and we may meet again.
<lb xmlns=""/>In mechanical execution—that is to say, in its general external and
<lb xmlns=""/>internal arrangement, the “ Aristidean” is infinitely before any Ame-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>rican magazine:—although the cover, perhaps, might be improved.
<lb xmlns=""/>In regard to its morale, the rock on which it seems most in danger of
<lb xmlns=""/>splitting is coarseness of vituperation. But if we are to choose be-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tween this and namby-pambyism, give us by all means not the latter.
<lb xmlns=""/>We sincerely wish the editor all the success which his vigorous abili-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ties deserve.
<lb xmlns=""/>MUSICAL. REVIEW.
<lb xmlns=""/>Melodies, by J. T. S. Sullivan, adapted to Airs, selected from the German
<lb xmlns=""/>Italian and French Composers. Published by George W. Appleton, 148
<lb xmlns=""/>Chesnut street, Philadelphia.
<lb xmlns=""/>Such is the title of a typed, or rather stereotyped work of some
<lb xmlns=""/>pretension. How it will support this pretension we shall see anon.
<lb xmlns=""/>We have heard of poems of every description being adapted to melo-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>dies, but we must candidly confess that we never before heard of Me-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>lodies being adapted to Airs. Byron and Moore wrote words to He-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>brew and Irish Melodies, and the joint production (words and music)
<lb xmlns=""/>was known as the Hebrew Melodies or the Irish Melodies. We think
<lb xmlns=""/>that it would be advisable to alter the title to one more comprehen-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>sive.
<lb xmlns=""/>The composers from whose works the airs are selected, are F.
<lb xmlns=""/>Schubert, Bellini, F. Wollank, and G. Doering, besides two airs, com-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>posers’ names not known. We think the selection very poor; they are,
<lb xmlns=""/>in fact, the veriest musical trifles that have come under our notice for
<lb xmlns=""/>a considerable period. From such an inexhaustible stock of good ma-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>terials, it is really a matter for wonder, that six such unimportant
<lb xmlns=""/>melodies or airs should have been chosen. It must have cost conside-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>rable trouble to pick them out. The music of Germany and France is
<lb xmlns=""/>particularly rich in songs, romances, and chorusses, and the amount
<lb xmlns=""/>of the beautiful in them is truly great. It would be a valuable gift to
<lb xmlns=""/>the musical world, if an extensive and judicious selection were made
<lb xmlns=""/>from these gems, and we believe Mr. Sullivan to be eminently calcu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>lated to adapt the poetry to them. We can find nothing to condemn
<lb xmlns=""/>in the present poetical portion of the work before us. It is carefully
<lb xmlns=""/>executed, the accentuation is well preserved, and the sentiments just-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ly conceived. We are pleased to be able to compliment Mr. Sullivan
<lb xmlns=""/>upon his taste.
<lb xmlns=""/>Where Art Thou, words by Mrs. Norton, are by no means adapted to
<lb xmlns=""/>the air Oft in the Stilly Night, there being one or two feet more in every
<lb xmlns=""/>line of her poem than there are in Moore’s. To adapt them, therefore,
<lb xmlns=""/>would require additional notes, to commence on the third beat, instead
<lb xmlns=""/>of the first of the bar, which would materially alter the character of
<lb xmlns=""/>the music. Why this poem is placed in this collection, (unless to fill
<lb xmlns=""/>up a space) especially as the music is not given, we are at a loss to
<lb xmlns=""/>understand. We like the idea of the work much, and it is probable
<lb xmlns=""/>that the selections may improve. We wish the undertaking every
<lb xmlns=""/>success, and hope to be able to give a more flattering account of the
<lb xmlns=""/>next number.
<lb xmlns=""/>Clydesdale Farewell, a Scottish ballad, written and composed by
<lb xmlns=""/>James Lawson. This ballad is written and composed by an amateur.
<lb xmlns=""/>Music owes a considerable debt of gratitude to musical amateurs, for
<lb xmlns=""/>the interest they take in the art, and for the many admirable contri-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>butions they have given to the world. The names of Lord Onslow,
<lb xmlns=""/>the Earl of Mornington, Beale, Rogers, and very many others, will be
<lb xmlns=""/>remembered by musicians with pleasure. We have, to be sure, very
<lb xmlns=""/>frequently to be lenient to the effect, for the sake of the cause.
<lb xmlns=""/>The ballad before us is simple and pretty. The composer has aim-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed at an imitation of the Scottish character, and if the imitation be
<lb xmlns=""/>not very close, it is at least near enough to fix the idea. The arrange-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ment is very easy, and the vocal part ranges within the compass of
<lb xmlns=""/>very little more than an octave. It will doubtless find many admirers
<lb xmlns=""/>and numerous purchasers.
<lb xmlns=""/>BERTINI'S PIANO FORTE METHOD. Published by W. H. Okes, and for sale by
<lb xmlns=""/>E. H. Wade, 197 Washington st. Boston.
<lb xmlns=""/>Our remarks upon this celebrated Instruction Book, have called forth
<lb xmlns=""/>many enquiries from various quarters, and as it is impossible for us to
<lb xmlns=""/>answer them individually, we take this opportunity to answer them
<lb xmlns=""/>en masse.
<lb xmlns=""/>What we have before said upon the excellences of this work, we find
<lb xmlns=""/>fully confirmed upon closer examination, and we have the testimony
<lb xmlns=""/>of many eminent men to the fact of its admirable adaptation to the use
<lb xmlns=""/>of students, and of its inevitable effect in producing brilliant and cer-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tain players, undeviating timeists, and in imparting a thorough theo-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>retical knowledge of the necessary principles of music, and a sterling
<lb xmlns=""/>and classical method of performance.
<lb xmlns=""/>We ourselves, have daily evidence of the benefit conferred upon pu-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>pils by the adoption of Bertini’s method; not alone in the mechanical
<lb xmlns=""/>but in the mental portion of the art, which is, after all, of the highest
<lb xmlns=""/>importance to the beginner, for unless the mind perceives and compre-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>hends what the hands have to execute, the progress must be slow and
<lb xmlns=""/>unsatisfactory in the extreme. The most intelligent master, without
<lb xmlns=""/>the assistance of some such work as this, and there is no work ex-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tant so perfect, must find an almost unconquerable difficulty in making
<lb xmlns=""/>clear to the perception of the pupil the minute divisions of time, and
<lb xmlns=""/>286
<lb xmlns=""/>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
<lb xmlns=""/>other particulars, which, though trifling in themselves, yet serve to
<lb xmlns=""/>make up an amount of mystery, to a youthful mind, hard to unravel.
<lb xmlns=""/>Of course these mysteries have been unravelled; each master hav-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ing some particular plan or method to elucidate the system. But how
<lb xmlns=""/>much labor may be saved the master ; how much mental puzzling and
<lb xmlns=""/>memory-staving may be spared the pupil, when a work is used which
<lb xmlns=""/>will lighten the toil of both. We have had many years’ experience in
<lb xmlns=""/>the instruction of young people, and have groaned in spirit for our-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>selves, and have mourned no less for those, who, lacking in quick ap-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>preciation, have toiled and struggled on through what must have ap-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>peared to them an endless sea of difficulty, and can, therefore, fully
<lb xmlns=""/>appreciate to the fullest extent all the advantages offered by the
<lb xmlns=""/>Method of Bertini.
<lb xmlns=""/>We promised in our notice of this work, to advise our young friends
<lb xmlns=""/>upon certain important and admirable portions of the Method for parti-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cular practice. We are unable to do so in this notice, from want of
<lb xmlns=""/>space. But we will do so, by and bye, as we do not think that too
<lb xmlns=""/>much attention can be drawn to an elementary work of such undoubt-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed merit.
<lb xmlns=""/>To those of our professional friends who have not already examined
<lb xmlns=""/>it, we earnestly recommend an early and faithful perusal of the work,
<lb xmlns=""/>for we feel convinced, that its general use will do more to correct the
<lb xmlns=""/>imperfect and superficial system of musical education now but too
<lb xmlns=""/>prevailing, than all that can be written or urged by the united power
<lb xmlns=""/>of the press.
<lb xmlns=""/>Piano-Fortes.—We recommend our musical friends to call at the
<lb xmlns=""/>store of Mr. T. H. Chambers, 385 Broadway, and try a seven octave
<lb xmlns=""/>instrument, which is now on exhibition there. It is really a most
<lb xmlns=""/>lovely instrument. It is clear, brilliant and powerful in tone, and at
<lb xmlns=""/>the same time sweet and melodious. The touch is light, free and
<lb xmlns=""/>springy, and the form is elegant and unique. He has many fine pianos
<lb xmlns=""/>in his store, but we desire to call particular attention to this one, as
<lb xmlns=""/>we think that it is one of the finest he has ever turned out.
<lb xmlns=""/>ITEMS.
<lb xmlns=""/>Park Theatre.—Mr. Anderson has just closed an engagement at
<lb xmlns=""/>this establishment, which has proved beyond a doubt, the most profi-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>table and the most honorable, both to the manager and the actor, to
<lb xmlns=""/>be found on record for many years. Mr. Anderson has won for himself
<lb xmlns=""/>the universal praise of the press, and he is the acknowledged and
<lb xmlns=""/>prime favorite of the public. He has won his laurels justly, and may
<lb xmlns=""/>he wear them long.
<lb xmlns=""/>Olympic Theatre.—This popular place of amusement, finished on
<lb xmlns=""/>Wednesday last, a season of the most unparalleled success. Mr. Mitch-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ell is undoubtedly the wisest and the most far-seeing of managers.
<lb xmlns=""/>His success cannot be attributed to individual excellence, but rather to
<lb xmlns=""/>the perfect ensemble. He deals not with stars, but he gathers around
<lb xmlns=""/>him a first-rate working team which he fashions to his hand, adapting
<lb xmlns=""/>them to the wants and the tastes of the public. Every novelty abroad
<lb xmlns=""/>—adapted to his company and his audience, finds its way to his thea-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tre in advance of all competitors. He is indefatigable in catering to
<lb xmlns=""/>the amusement of the public, and hence his unwavering success.
<lb xmlns=""/>Mr. Mitchell departs upon a professional tour next week. He will
<lb xmlns=""/>visit Boston first we believe.
<lb xmlns=""/>Concert for the Benefit of Mr. W. Alpers.—It is proposed, we
<lb xmlns=""/>understand, to give a grand concert in a short time, for the benefit of
<lb xmlns=""/>Mr. Alpers, who has been laboring for a considerable period under se-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>vere sickness. We are sure that every member of the profession will
<lb xmlns=""/>volunteer their services with hearty good will upon the occasion, for
<lb xmlns=""/>Mr. Alpers is esteemed and respected upon every hand. We know
<lb xmlns=""/>him to be one of the most worthy members of the profession—talent-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ed, learned, accomplished, and willing to assist all who are in need of
<lb xmlns=""/>his assistance.
<lb xmlns=""/>We earnestly appeal to the public and the profession, to come for-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ward and give substantial evidence of their appreciation of his merits,
<lb xmlns=""/>upon this deeply interesting and truly sad occasion.
<lb xmlns=""/>Mary Taylor, it is said, will proceed to Boston, after the closing of
<lb xmlns=""/>the Olympic, which will lake place this week, and returns to fulfill an
<lb xmlns=""/>engagement at Niblo’s, which will open early in June.
<lb xmlns=""/>Mr. George Loder has become the organist of Grace Church, and is
<lb xmlns=""/>succeeded in the Market St. church by Mr. Bristow, who is succeeded
<lb xmlns=""/>by Mr. Harrison in St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Instability is the order of
<lb xmlns=""/>the day.
<lb xmlns=""/>NATIONAL NOMENCLATURE.
<lb xmlns=""/>Although we have approved the recommendation of the Commit-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tee of the Historical Society, in regard to changing the national name,
<lb xmlns=""/>yet we must acknowledge that we have had but little faith that the
<lb xmlns=""/>people would be influenced by the recommendation. Names of coun-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tries must be of spontaneous generation, but when one is given by
<lb xmlns=""/>law it may be as well not to disturb it. As our nation extends its
<lb xmlns=""/>boundaries, the States must grow more provincial, and from necessity
<lb xmlns=""/>the people will be called after their provinces rather than the conti-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>nent which they inhabit. We shall learn to call each other, and shall
<lb xmlns=""/>be distinguished abroad as Vermonters, Virginians or Texans. But
<lb xmlns=""/>there is a difficulty in the awkward names of some of the Slates—as
<lb xmlns=""/>Massachusetts, Ohio, New Hampshire, &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;c. Necessity, however, who
<lb xmlns=""/>is always ready with an invention, when one is needed, will never fail
<lb xmlns=""/>to supply a nick-name without the help of any other society than so-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ciety at large. The following list of national nick-names, which we
<lb xmlns=""/>cut from an exchange paper, shows how little we need apprehend a
<lb xmlns=""/>dearth of distinctive titles by which we may be known.
<lb xmlns=""/>The inhabitants of
<lb xmlns=""/>Maine, are called	Foxes.
<lb xmlns=""/>New Hampshire,	Granite boys.
<lb xmlns=""/>Massachusetts,	Bay Staters.
<lb xmlns=""/>Vermont,	Green Mountain Boys.
<lb xmlns=""/>Rhode-Island,	Gun Flints.
<lb xmlns=""/>Connecticut,	Wooden Nutmegs.

<lb xmlns=""/>Ohio,	Buck-eyes.
<lb xmlns=""/>Indiana,	Hoosiers.
<lb xmlns=""/>Illinois,	Suckers.
<lb xmlns=""/>Missouri,	Pewks.

<lb xmlns=""/>Wisconsin,	Badgers.
<lb xmlns=""/>Iowa,	Hawkeyes.
<lb xmlns=""/>N. W. Territory,	Prairie Dogs.
<lb xmlns=""/>Oregon,	Hard Cases.
<lb xmlns=""/>Popular Lectures.—We looked into some forty or fifty exchange
<lb xmlns=""/>papers one day last week, and found in every one of them, from city
<lb xmlns=""/>and country, Mrs. Caudle’s lectures from Punch. This led us first to
<lb xmlns=""/>read them and then to reflect on the cause of their popularity. They
<lb xmlns=""/>are evidently a hit. Yet they possess no particular interest, no story,
<lb xmlns=""/>no plot, no wit, no puns, nothing thrilling or exciting, but only a few
<lb xmlns=""/>little touches of nature which have found admission into every heart
<lb xmlns=""/>at which they have knocked. We will venture to assert that no lady
<lb xmlns=""/>will see anything to admire or laugh at in Mrs. Caudle’s lectures.
<lb xmlns=""/>But they are immensely popular among husbands, who have all heard
<lb xmlns=""/>something like them, and out of pure spile to their Mrs. Caudles, all
<lb xmlns=""/>who have newspapers under their control, publish the lectures to let
<lb xmlns=""/>the world into secrets that they dare not directly divulge. Laman
<lb xmlns=""/>Blanchard has been named as the author of these popular lectures,
<lb xmlns=""/>but that is an error : they are by another hand. Let him be who he
<lb xmlns=""/>may, he relates his own experiences; there is more truth in Mrs. Cau-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>dle’s curtain lectures than in any course of scientific lectures that we
<lb xmlns=""/>are acquainted with. Dr. Lardner’s were not half so popular because
<lb xmlns=""/>they were not half so true.
<lb xmlns=""/>The Way they do things in England.—The Committee of the
<lb xmlns=""/>Royal Corporation of the Literary Fund, at its meeting on Wednesday
<lb xmlns=""/>the 19th ult. unanimously voted 100l. towards the fund now raising for
<lb xmlns=""/>the benefit of the family of the late Laman Blanchard.
<lb xmlns=""/>We learn that Mr. Howitt is engaged on a work which has occupied
<lb xmlns=""/>more or less of his attention for some years, viz. “ Visits to the Birth-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>places and Resorts of the most eminent English Poets.” It will in-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>clude not only visits to many of the most interesting spots in England,
<lb xmlns=""/>Ireland, and Scotland, but also in Switzerland, Italy, &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;c.

<lb xmlns=""/>THIS School differs essentially from most others in

<lb xmlns=""/>Mr. Kirkland resided some years in Europe for the express purpose of
<lb xmlns=""/>qualifying himself as an instructor.
<lb xmlns=""/>The French language is taught by an approved master, a native of France;
<lb xmlns=""/>and every facility is afforded for practice, both in the school and in the family.
<lb xmlns=""/>The plan of in*truct.on embraces three divisions. The Initiatory Course in-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cludes Grammar, Geography, American History, Writing and Arithmetic,
<lb xmlns=""/>with Composition. Reading* aloud, Spelling and Definition, form part of the
<lb xmlns=""/>daily exercises of the whole school.
<lb xmlns=""/>The Second continues the above-named studies, with the addition of An-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>cient and Modern History and the French Language.
<lb xmlns=""/>In the higher or Ӕsthetic course all the usual branches of a thorough En-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>glish course of education are included, with French, German, Latin and
<lb xmlns=""/>Greek, according to the wish of the parent and the capacity of the scholar.
<lb xmlns=""/>Pupils in this course pay particular attention to Poetry, to the art of Com-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>position, and to the Philosophy of History. Moral Philosophy is taught from
<lb xmlns=""/>Dymond, as abridged and prepared for schools by Mrs. Kirkland. Lectures
<lb xmlns=""/>on various subjects are delivered by Mr. and Mrs. Kirkland, and others; and
<lb xmlns=""/>the general course of study is advanced and rendered interesting by copious
<lb xmlns=""/>illustrations from French and English Literature.

<lb xmlns=""/>MR. LARRABEE, Manufacturer of the “ BŒhm
<lb xmlns=""/>FLUTE," 110 FULTON ST. N.Y., anxious to introduce to the Amateurs of

<lb xmlns=""/>THE Subscribers, while returning thanks to their
<lb xmlns=""/>numerous friends and to the public, would, atthe same time, call atten-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tion to their Stock of Instruments, of six and seven octaves, just finished, in
<lb xmlns=""/>elegant Rosewood and Mahogany cases.
<lb xmlns=""/>The Subscribers, from their long experience in every department of the

<lb xmlns=""/>BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
<lb xmlns=""/>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
<lb xmlns=""/>work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this method
<lb xmlns=""/>the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prom-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>inent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies, are
<lb xmlns=""/>given in such PROGRESSIVE order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
<lb xmlns=""/>carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
<lb xmlns=""/>otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
<lb xmlns=""/>has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account,
<lb xmlns=""/>and it is only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils, will be en
<lb xmlns=""/>abled to READ music with facility, and at the same time become good musi
<lb xmlns=""/>cians
<lb xmlns=""/>This method commence* in the most plain and simple manner; the rud-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ments of music being given and illustrated at the same time and each lesson
<lb xmlns=""/>is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.	“lcs!on
<lb xmlns=""/>The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from pro-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>fessional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of BERTINI's METHOD
<lb xmlns=""/>over all others yet published in this country, most of them having used the
<lb xmlns=""/>foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to give a few of the
<lb xmlns=""/>names in the principal cities.

<lb xmlns=""/>LONDON, EDINBURGH, FOREIGN, and WEST-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/> MINSTER QUARTERLY REVIEWS, and BLACKWOOD’S MAGA-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>ZINE.
<lb xmlns=""/>The above Periodicals are reprinted in New-York, immediately on their
<lb xmlns=""/>arrival by the British steamers, in a beautiful clear type, on line white paper
<lb xmlns=""/>and are faithful copies of the originals—Blackwood’s Magazine being an ex-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>act fac-simile of the Edinburgh Edition.
<lb xmlns=""/>The wide spread fame of these splendid Periodicals renders it needless to
<lb xmlns=""/>say much to their praise. As literary organs, they stand far in advance of
<lb xmlns=""/>any works of a similar stamp now published, while their political complexion
<lb xmlns=""/>is marked by a dignity, candor, ana forbearance not often found in works of
<lb xmlns=""/>a party character.
<lb xmlns=""/>They embrace the views of the three great parties in England, Whig, Tory,
<lb xmlns=""/>and Radical. “ Blackwood” and the “ London Quarterly” are Tory ; the
<lb xmlns=""/>“ Edinburgh Review” Whig ; and the “ Westminster” Radical. The “ For-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>eign Quarterly” is purely literary, being devoted principally to criticisms on
<lb xmlns=""/>foreign Continental Works.
<lb xmlns=""/>The prices of the Re-Prints are less than one third of those of the foreign
<lb xmlns=""/>copies ; and while they are equally well got up, they afford all that advan-
<lb xmlns="" break="no"/>tage to the American over the English reader.
<lb xmlns=""/>TERMS.—Payment to be made in Advance.
