           <head>A Walk to Flatbush.</head>
             <p>The earth seems quiet like some docile thing
<lb/>Obeying the blue beauty of the skies.	Proctor.</p>
             <p>On Saturday last, a couple of friends and myself determined to
<lb/>leave the City with its noise and distraction for a quiet walk
<lb/>through some of Nature’s gentle scenes. Sincerity, a love for the
<lb/>country, and a spirit of enjoyment, the power of extracting good
<lb/>and beauty from the simplest objects, are all that are required in
<lb/>a companion for a rural walk. I was doubly rich in my two
<lb/>friends. The one, a young lawyer, was glad enough to escape
<lb/>from the drudgery of a toilsome profession. His looks brightened
<lb/>up, good talk flowed freely from his lips, his step was buoyant 
<lb/>and triumphant, and his cane came down with a ringing sound,<cb n="2"/>
<lb/>as we walked through the lovely City of Brooklyn. He was
<lb/> humming “Begone dull care.” He is one of those, whose qual-
<lb break="no"/>ities of head and heart but few of his acquaintance appreciate,
<lb/>for they sink into an absorbent ground of modesty and quiet
<lb/>manners. He is truthful, has a well regulated mind, he loves a
<lb/>beautiful landscape and house and grounds, has good taste, is
<lb/>gentlemanly, plays on several instruments skilfully, and sings
<lb/>well—enjoys a good story, and will tell an effective one in re-
<lb break="no"/>turn. He laments that the happy days of his boyhood have
<lb/>passed away, and speaks with rapture of his Saturday holiday
<lb/>enjoyments, when life’s mere and breathing charm, was sufficient
<lb/>for his comfort. The other of my companions has written much,
<lb/>clearly expressed, and with a large portion of bland, heart-easing
<lb/>philosophy. He is very agreeable, notwithstanding he stutters
<lb/>somewhat in his eagerness to be delivered of his good sayings.
<lb/>He has a few choice books, with which he is thoroughly imbued.
<lb/>There is nothing narrow in his taste. He relishes Hooker, and
<lb/>is an admirer of John Buncle. He reads novels and sermons, and
<lb/>finds both admirable. He goes to theatres, concerts, and churches,
<lb/>and finds them all interesting and instructive. He sometimes in-
<lb break="no"/>dulges himself in imitating Methodist preachers in a stentorian
<lb/>voice and with uplifted eyes, in a capital style and with great
<lb/>unction. A ranting actor he does to the life. He loves and is
<lb/>beloved by children; a sure test of his amiability. He is a great
<lb/>admirer of Hazlitt, and is alive to the merits of Steele and Addi-
<lb break="no"/>son. He has an old beautiful copy of Walton’s Angler which
<lb/>he cherishes lovingly. The names of Rubens and Vandyke
<lb/>sound pleasantly in his ear. He shakes hands heartily in a man-
<lb break="no"/>ner which plainly says, “My dear boy, I am heartily glad to see
<lb/>you.” Then comes sincere talk, and you hear spoons tinkling in
<lb/>tumblers, and some old Brandy or Jamaica appears blushingly on
<lb/>the scene, and then for a walk. He has good sense, a correct
<lb/>taste, and a straight-forwardness of head and heart which are as
<lb/>rare as they are delightful. He ought to have a fortune aad
<lb/>keep open house all the year; it would snow meat and drink.
<lb/>He sees God’s goodness in the tiny flower and in the giant oak.
<lb/>He conceives life to be a blessing, and talks not of the sinful
<lb/>flesh. If there were more of his nature in the world, society
<lb/>would improve faster than it does.</p>
            <p>The morning was clear, the air pure and bracing, and we
<lb/>went briskly on our winding way. The sun shone brightly
<lb/>through the few remaining leaves that still clung to the gray
<lb/>branches; their brethren that had once sparkled with them in
<lb/>green beauty, when they were refreshed by summer showers,
<lb/>now lay piled in heaps by the road side, and rustled to our tread.
<lb/>On the top of one of the hills we had an extensive view of Brook-
<lb break="no"/>lyn, the Narrows, Staten Island, the Jersey shore, and New York;
<lb/>and in the opposite direction the ocean with its melancholy waste
<lb/>melted into the sky. Some sheltered fields were still covered
<lb/>with a tender green. At length, when we reached Flatbush, there
<lb/>was an exclamation of delight from us all. The houses look
<lb/>like homes, the abodes of quiet and contentment. They give
<lb/>one a perfect idea of cleanliness and comfort. A Sabbath silence
<lb/>brooded over the whole scene. The city, with its cares, and crimes
<lb/>and pains, was forgotten. We were boys again. A walk through<pb n="382"/><cb n="1"/>
<lb/>Flatbush is delightful, for each side of the path is lined with
<lb/>trees, and it is serpentine. If it looks like fairy land in Novem-
<lb break="no"/>ber, it must be a bower of bliss in “the leafy month of June.”
<lb/>In front of one of the inns, we saw an old weather-beaten sign,
<lb/>a lion rampant: we liked the looks of it better than we did those
<lb/>of its newer and glossier neighbors. We went in, and there</p>
              <p>Arrangement neat, and chastest order reign.—Young.</p>
              <p>Not a speck of dust was to be seen. Woman’s care, and taste,
<lb/>were everywhere visible. We were waited upon by a young
<lb/>woman, neatly attired, and well bred. We determined to dine
<lb/>there, and when the dinner was prepared we were shown through
<lb/>rambling rooms to an apartment that we judged to be the sitting-
<lb break="no"/>room of the females of the family. It was well warmed, a cana-
<lb break="no"/>ry bird was bathing himself in the warm sunshine—there was a
<lb/>piano in the room, and a painting, most likely of sisters, with
<lb/>sweet eyes and rosy lips was hung over it; there was also an
<lb/>old-fashioned side-board, and the same scrupulous neatness. The
<lb/>dinner was excellent and would have sharpened the most fastidi-
<lb break="no"/>ous appetite. After the meal was dispatched, a polite, good-
<lb break="no"/>looking girl procured the key of the piano, and the young lawyer
<lb/>made it discourse most eloquent music—the tones sank into the
<lb/>heart, and harmonized with file quiet and orderly spot in which
<lb/>we were; the sun shed a golden tinge on some vine-leaves by
<lb/>the window, and the garden paths looked as if the broom had
<lb/>just passed over them. We felt a delicious repose</p>
                  <lg><l>A wise man never will be sad;</l>
                  <l>But neither will sonorous bubbling mirth,</l>
                  <l>A shallow stream of happiness betray—</l>
                  <l>Too happy to be sportive, he’s serene.</l></lg>
               <p>After luxuriating till warned by the gloaming to depart, we bid
<lb/>a kind adieu to our fair entertainers and set our faces towards
<lb/>home. Our way was cheered with conversation about our pleas-
<lb break="no"/>ant ramble, our delicious fare, and the inn, that we all insisted
<lb/>on never was, and never could be surpassed. The shades of
<lb/>evening surrounded us before we reached Brooklyn; the air was
<lb/>still; not a sound was heard, save</p>
            <p>The watch-dog’s voice that bay’d the whispering wind.</p>
            <p>Arrived home, we rejoiced that the day had passed so happily.</p>
            <p>Prosperity to Flatbush, and the inn with the sign of the lion-
<lb/>rampant.</p>	<byline><persName>G. F. D.</persName></byline></div>

             <head>Mystification. </head>
               <p>Slid, if these be your “passados” and “montantes,” I’ll have none
<lb/>o’them.—Ned Knowles.</p>
               <p>The Baron Ritzner Von Jung was of a noble Hungarian family,
<lb/>every member of which (at least as far back into antiquity as any
<lb/>certain records extend) was more or less remarkable for talent
<lb/>of some description,—the majority for that species of grotesquerie
<lb/>in conception of which Tieck, a scion of the house, has given
<lb/>some vivid, although by no means the most vivid exemplifications.
<lb/>My acquaintance with Ritzner commenced at the magnificent
<lb/>Chateau Jung, into which a train of droll adventures, not to be
<lb/>made public, threw me during the summer months of the year
<lb/>18—. Here it was I obtained a place in his regard, and
<lb/>here, with somewhat more difficulty, a partial insight into his
<lb/>mental conformation. In later days this insight grew more clear,
<lb/>as the intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close;
<lb/>and when, after three years separation, we met at G—————n, I
<lb/>knew all that it was necessary to know of the character of the
<lb/>Baron Ritzner Von Jung</p>
                <p>I remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited with-
<lb break="no"/>in the college precincts on the night of the twenty-fifth of June. I
<lb/>remember still more distinctly, that while he was pronounced by
<lb/>all parties at first sight “the most remarkable man in the world,”
<lb/>no person made any attempt at accounting for this opinion. That
<lb/>he was unique appeared so undeniable, that it was deemed imper-
<lb break="no"/>tinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted. But, letting
<lb/>this matter pass for the present, I will merely observe that, from
<lb/>the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the uni-
<lb break="no"/>versity, he began to exercise over the habits, manners, persons
<lb/>purses, and propensities of the whole community which surrounded
<lb/>him, an influence the most extensive and despotic, yet at the
<lb/>same time the most indefinitive and altogether unaccountable.
<lb/>Thus the brief period of his residence at the university forms an
<lb/>era in its annals, and is characterized by all classes of people
<lb/>appertaining to it or its dependencies as “that very extraordinary
<lb/>epoch forming the domination of the Baron Ritzner Von Jung.”</p><pb n="383"/><cb n="1"/>
                <p>Upon his advent to G——————n, he sought me out in my apart-
<lb break="no"/>ments. He was then of no particular age;—by which I mean
<lb/>that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any
<lb/>data personally afforded. He might have been fifteen or fifty,
<lb/>and was twenty-one years and seven months. He was by no
<lb/>means a handsome man—perhaps the reverse. The contour of
<lb/>his face was somewhat angular and harsh. His forehead was
<lb/>lofty and very fair; his nose a snub; his eyes large, heavy,
<lb/>glassy and meaningless. About the mouth there was more to be
<lb/>observed. The lips were gently protruded, and rested the one
<lb/>upon the other after such fashion that it is impossible to conceive
<lb/>any, even the most complex, combination of human features, con-
<lb break="no"/>veying so entirely, and so singly, the idea of unmitigated gravity-
<lb break="no"/>solemnity and repose.</p>
                <p>It will be perceived, no doubt, from what I have already said,
<lb/>that the Baron was one of those human anomalies now and then
<lb/>to be found, who make the science of mystification the study and
<lb/>the business of their lives. For this science a peculiar turn of
<lb/>mind gave him instinctively the cue, while his physical appear-
<lb break="no"/>ance afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his projects into
<lb/>effect. I firmly believe that no student at G——————n, during that
<lb/>renowned epoch so quaintly termed the domination of the
<lb/>Baron Ritzner Von Jung, ever rightly entered into the mystery
<lb/>which overshadowed his character. I truly think that no person
<lb/>at the university, with the exception of myself, ever suspected
<lb/>him to be capable of a joke, verbal or practical:—the old bull-dog
<lb/>at the garden-gate would sooner have been accused,—the ghost of
<lb/>Heraclitus,—or the wig of the Emeritus Professor of Theology.
<lb/>This, too, when it was evident that the most egregious and un-
<lb break="no"/>pardonable of all conceivable tricks, whimsicalities, and buffoon-
<lb break="no"/>eries were brought about, if not directly by him, at least plainly
<lb/>through his intermediate agency or connivance. The beauty, if
<lb/>I may so call it, of his art mystifique, lay in that consummate
<lb/>ability (resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human
<lb/>nature, and a most wonderful self-possession,) by means of
<lb/>which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries
<lb/>he was occupied in bringing to a point, arose partly in spite,
<lb/>and partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was mak-
<lb break="no"/>ing for their prevention, and for the preservation of the good
<lb/>order and dignity of Alma Mater. The deep, the poignant, the
<lb/>overwhelming mortification which, upon each such failure of his
<lb/>praiseworthy endeavors, would suffuse every lineament of his
<lb/>countenance, left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity
<lb/>in the bosoms of even his most sceptical companions. The adroit-
<lb break="no"/>ness, too, was no less worthy of observation by which he con-
<lb break="no"/>trived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the
<lb/>created—from his own person to the absurdities to which he had
<lb/>given rise. In no instance before that of which I speak, have I
<lb/>known the habitual mystific escape the natural consequence of
<lb/>his manoeuvres—an attachment of the ludicrous to his own char-
<lb break="no"/>acter and person. Continually enveloped in an atmosphere of
<lb/>whim, my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society;
<lb/>and not even his own household have for a moment associated
<lb/>other ideas than those of the rigid and august with the memory
<lb/>of the Baron Ritzner Von Jung.</p>
               <p>During the epoch of his residence at G—————n it really appeared
<lb/>that the demon of the dolce far niente lay like an incubus upon
<lb/>the university. Nothing at least, was done, beyond eating and
<lb/>drinking, and making merry. The apartments of the students
<lb/>were converted into so many pot-houses, and there was no pot-
<lb break="no"/>house of them all more famous or more frequented than that of
<lb/>the Baron. Our carousals here were many, and boisterous, and
<lb/>long, and never unfruitful of events.</p>
            <p>Upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly<cb n="2"/>
<lb/>daybreak, and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk.
<lb/>The company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the
<lb/>Baron and myself. Most of these were young men of wealth, of
<lb/>high connection, of great family pride, and all alive with an ex-
<lb break="no"/>aggerated sense of honor. They abounded in the most ultra
<lb/>German opinions respecting the duello. To these Quixotic notions
<lb/>some recent Parisian publications, backed by three or four despe-
<lb break="no"/>rate and fatal recontres at G——————n, had given new vigor and
<lb/>impulse; and thus the conversation, during the greater part of
<lb/>the night, had run wild upon the all-engrossing topic of the times.
<lb/>The Baron, who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the
<lb/>earlier portion of the evening, at length seemed to be aroused
<lb/>from his apathy, took a leading part in the discourse, and dwelt
<lb/>upon the benefits, and more especially upon the beauties, of the
<lb/>received code of etiquette in passages of arms, with an ardor, an
<lb/>eloquence, an impressiveness, and an affectionateness of manner,
<lb/>which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general,
<lb/>and absolutely staggered even myself, who well knew him to be
<lb/>at heart a ridiculer of those very points for which he contended,
<lb/>and especially to hold the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette
<lb/>in the sovereign contempt which it deserves.</p>
             <p>Looking around me during a pause in the Baron’s discourse,
<lb/>(of which, my readers may gather some faint idea when I say
<lb/>that it bore resemblance to the fervid, chanting, monoto-
<lb break="no"/>nous, yet musical, sermonic manner of Coleridge,) I perceived
<lb/>symptoms of even more than the general interest in the counte-
<lb break="no"/>nance of one of the party. This gentleman, whom I shall call
<lb/>Hermann, was an original in every respect—except, perhaps, in
<lb/>the single particular that he was a very great fool. He contrived
<lb/>to bear, however, among a particular set at the university, a rep-
<lb break="no"/>utation for deep metaphysical thinking, and, I believe, for some
<lb/>logical talent. As a duellist he had acquired great renown, even
<lb/>at G———n. I forget the precise number of victims who had fal-
<lb break="no"/>len at his hands; but they were many. He was a man of cour-
<lb break="no"/>age undoubtedly. But it was upon his minute acquaintance with
<lb/>the etiquette of the duello, and the nicety of his sense of honor,
<lb/>that he most especially prided himself. These things were a hob-
<lb break="no"/>by which he rode to the death. To Ritzner, ever upon the look-
<lb break="no"/>out for the grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time past
<lb/>afforded food for mystification. Of this, however, I was not
<lb/>aware; although, in the present instance, I saw clearly that some-
<lb break="no"/>thing of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend,
<lb/>and that Hermann was its especial object.</p>
             <p>As the former proceeded in his discourse, or rather monologue,
<lb/>I perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing. At
<lb/>length he spoke; offering some objection to a point insisted upon
<lb/>by R., and giving his reasons in detail. To these the Baron re-
<lb break="no"/>plied at length (still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment)
<lb/>and concluding, in what I thought very bad taste, with a sarcasm
<lb/>and a sneer. The hobby of Hermann now took the bit in his
<lb/>teeth. This I could discern by the studied hair-splitting farrago
<lb/>of his rejoinder. His last words I distinctly remember. “our
<lb/>opinions, allow me to say, Baron Von Jung, although in the
<lb/>main correct, are, in many nice points, discreditable to yourself
<lb/>and to the university of which you are a member. In a few re-
<lb break="no"/>spects they are even unworthy of serious refutation. I would
<lb/>say more than this, sir, were it not for the fear of giving you of-
<lb break="no"/>fence (here the speaker smiled blandly,) I would say, sir, that
<lb/>your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gen-
<lb break="no"/>tleman.”</p>
            <p>As Hermann completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were
<lb/>turned upon the Baron. He became pale, then excessively red,
<lb/>then, dropping his pocket-handkerchief, stooped to recover it,
<lb/>when I caught a glimpse of his countenance, while it could be<pb n="384"/><cb n="1"/>
<lb/>seen by no one else at the table. It was radiant with the quiz-
<lb break="no"/>zical expression which was its natural character, but which I
<lb/>had never seen it assume except when we were alone together, 
<lb/>and when he unbent himself freely. In an instant afterward he
<lb/>stood erect, confronting Hermann; and so total an alteration of!
<lb/>countenance in so short a period I certainly never saw before,
<lb/>For a moment I even fancied that I had misconceived him, and I
<lb/>that he was in sober earnest. He appeared to be stifling with
<lb/>passion, and his face was cadaverously white. For a short time
<lb/>he remained silent, apparently striving to master his emotion.
<lb/>Having at length seemingly succeeded, he reached a decanter
<lb/>which stood near him, saying, as he held it firmly clenched—
<lb/>“The language you have thought proper to employ, Mynheer
<lb/>Hermann, in addressing yourself to me, is objectionable in so
<lb/>many particulars, that I have neither temper nor time for specifi-
<lb break="no"/>cation. That my opinions, however, are not the opinions to be
<lb/>expected from a gentleman, is an observation so directly offensive
<lb/>as to allow me but one line of conduct. Some courtesy, never-
<lb break="no"/>theless, is due to the presence of this company, and to yourself,
<lb/>at this moment, as my guest. You will pardon me, therefore, if,
<lb/>upon this consideration, I deviate slightly from the general usage
<lb/>among gentleman in similar cases of personal affront. You will
<lb/>forgive me for the moderate tax I shall make upon your imagina-
<lb break="no"/>tion, and endeavor to consider, for an instant, the reflection of
<lb/>your person in yonder mirror as the living Mynheer Hermann him-
<lb break="no"/>self. This being done, there will be no difficulty whatever. I
<lb/>shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yonder
<lb/>mirror, and thus fulfil all the spirit, if not the exact letter, of re-
<lb break="no"/>sentment for your insult, while the necessity of physical violence
<lb/>to your real person will be obviated.”</p>
            <p>With these words he hurled the decanter, full of wine, against
<lb/>the mirror which hung directly opposite Hermann; striking the
<lb/>reflection of his person with great precision, and of course shat-
<lb break="no"/>tering the glass into fragments. The whole company at once
<lb/>started to their feet, and, with the exception of myself and Ritzner,
<lb/>took their departure. As Hermann went out, the Baron whis-
<lb break="no"/>pered me that I should follow him and make an offer of my ser-
<lb break="no"/>vices. To this I agreed; not knowing precisely what to make
<lb/>of so ridiculous a piece of business.</p>
            <p>The duellist accepted my aid with his usual stiff and ultra
<lb/>recherché air, and taking my arm, led me to his apartment. I could
<lb/>hardly forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to dicuss,
<lb/>with the profoundest gravity, what he termed “the refinedly pe-
<lb break="no"/>culiar character” of the insult he had received. After a tiresome
<lb/>harangue in his ordinary style, he took down from his book-
<lb break="no"/>shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello,
<lb/>and entertained me for a long time with their contents; reading
<lb/>aloud, and commenting earnestly as he read. I can just remem-
<lb break="no"/>ber the titles of some of the works. There were the “Ordonnance
<lb/>of Philip le Bel on Single Combat;” the “Theatre of Honor,',
<lb/>by Favyn, and a treatise “On the Permission of Duels,” by An-
<lb break="no"/>diguier. He displayed, also, with much pomposity, Brantome’s
<lb/>“Memoirs of Duels,” published at Cologne, in 1666, in the types
<lb/>of Elzevir—a precious and unique vellum-paper volume, with a
<lb/>fine margin, and bound by Derome. But he requested my atten-
<lb break="no"/>tion particularly, and with an air of mysterious sagacity, to a
<lb/>thick octavo, written in barbarous Latin by one Hedelin, a French-
<lb break="no"/>man, and having the quaint title, “Duelli Lex scripta, et non;
<lb/>aliterque. From this he read me one of the drollest chapters in
<lb/>the world concerning “Injuriæ per applicationem, per construe,
<lb/>tionem, et per se,” about half of which, he averred, was strictly
<lb/>applicable to his own “refinedly peculiar” case, although not
<lb/>one syllable of the whole matter could I understand for the life
<lb/>of me. Having finished the chapter, he closed the book, and de-<cb n="2"/>
<lb break="no"/>manded what I thought necessary to be done. I replied that I
<lb/>had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling, and
<lb/>would abide by what he proposed. With this answer he seemed
<lb/>flattered, and sat down to write a note to the Baron. It ran thus:</p>
            <p>Sir,—My friend, M. P——, will hand you this note. I find
<lb/>it incumbent upon me to request, at your earliest convenience, an
<lb/>explanation of this evening’s occurrences at your chambers, In
<lb/>the event of your declining this request, Mr. P. will be happy to
<lb/>arrange, with any friend whom you may appoint, the steps pre-
<lb break="no"/>liminary to a meeting.</p>
            <p>With sentiments of perfect respect,</p>
            <p>Your most humble servant,</p>
            <p>Johan Hermann.</p>
            <p>To the Baron Ritzner Von Jung,</p>
            <p>August 18th, 18—.</p>
            <p>Not knowing what better to do, I called upon Ritzner with
<lb/>this epistle. He bowed as I presented it; then, with a grave coun-
<lb break="no"/>tenance, motioned me to a seat. Having perused the cartel, he
<lb/>wrote the following reply, which I carried to Hermann.</p>
            <p>Sir,</p>
            <p>Through our common friend, Mr. P., I have received your
<lb/>note of this evening. Upon due reflection I frankly admit the
<lb/>propriety of the explanation you suggest. This being admitted,
<lb/>I still find great difficulty, (owing to the refinedly peculiar nature
<lb/>of our disagreement, and of the personal affront offered on my
<lb/>part,) in so wording what I have to say by way of apology, as
<lb/>to meet all the minute exigencies, and all the variable shadows
<lb/>of the case. I have great reliance, however, on that extreme
<lb/>delicacy of discrimination, in matters appertaining to the rules of
<lb/>etiquette, for which you have been so long and so preeminently
<lb/>distinguished. With perfect certainty, therefore, of being com-
<lb break="no"/>prehended, I beg leave, in lieu of offering any sentiments of my
<lb/>own, to refer you to the opinions of the Sieur Hedelin, as set
<lb/>forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of “Injuriæ per ap-
<lb break="no"/>plicationem, per constructionem, et per se,'' in his “Duelli Lex
<lb/>scripta, et non; aliterque.’’ The nicety of your discernment in all
<lb/>the matters here treated, will be sufficient, I am assured, to con-
<lb break="no"/>vince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this
<lb/>admirable passage, ought to satisfy your request, as a man of hon-
<lb break="no"/>or, for explanation.</p>
            <p>With sentiments of profound respect,</p>
            <p>Your most obedient servant,</p>
            <p>Von Jung.</p>
            <p>The Herr Johan Hermann.</p>
            <p>August 18th, 18—.</p>
            <p>Hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl,
<lb/>which, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous
<lb/>self-complacency as he came to the rigmarole about Injuria per
<lb/>applicationem, per constructionem, et per se. Having finished read-
<lb break="no"/>ing, he begged me, with the blandest of all possible smiles, to be
<lb/>seated, while he made reference to the treatise in question. Turn-
<lb break="no"/>ing to the passage specified, he read it with great care to himself,
<lb/>then closed the book, and desired me, in my character of confi-
<lb break="no"/>dential acquaintance, to express to the Baron Von Jung his exalted
<lb/>sense of his chivalrous behaviour, and, in that of second, to as-
<lb break="no"/>sure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest, the most
<lb/>honorable, and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature.</p>
            <p>Somewhat amazed at all this, I made my retreat to the Baron.
<lb/>He seemed to receive Hermann’s amicable letter as a matter of
<lb/>course, and after a few words of general conversation, went to
<lb/>an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise “Duelli<pb n="385"/><cb n="1"/>
<lb/>Lex scripta, et non; aliterque.” He handed me the volume and
<lb/>asked me to look over some portion of it. I did so, but to little
<lb/>purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning.
<lb/>He then took the book himself, and read me a chapter aloud.
<lb/>To my surprise, what he read proved to be a most horribly ab-
<lb break="no"/>surd account of a duel between two baboons. He now explain-
<lb break="no"/>ed the mystery; showing that the volume, as it appeared prima
<lb/>facie, was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of Du
<lb/>Bartas; that is to say, the language was ingeniously framed so
<lb/>as to present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility,
<lb/>and even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow of meaning
<lb/>existed. The key to the whole was found in leaving out every
<lb/>second and third word alternately, when there appeared a series
<lb/>of ludicrous quizzes upon single combat as practised in modern
<lb/>times.</p>
            <p>The Baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely
<lb/>thrown the treatise in Hermann’s way two or three weeks before
<lb/>the adventure, and that he was satisfied, from the general tenor
<lb/>of his conversation, that he had studied it with the deepest at-
<lb break="no"/>tention, and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit.
<lb/>Upon this hint he proceeded. Hermann would have die! a thou-
<lb break="no"/>sand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand
<lb/>anything and everything in the universe that had ever been
<lb/>written about the duello.</p>	<byline><persName>Littleton Barry</persName>.</byline></div>

                <p>The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley. First American Edi-
<lb break="no"/>tion (Complete); with some remarks on the Poetical Faculty, and
<lb/>its influence on Human Destiny. Embracing a Biographical
<lb/>and Critical Notice, by G. G. Foster, New York. J. S. Red-
<lb break="no"/>field, Clinton Hall.</p>
                <p>This is a very beautiful edition of a poet whom all poets, and
<lb/>whom poets only, appreciate. The volume is a pendant of the
<lb/>Carey’s Dante lately issued by D. Appleton &amp; Co., and includes
<lb/>750 pages duodecimo—fine type and exquisite paper. It is, as
<lb/>asserted, a complete edition of the works of the author—rather too
<lb/>complete, perhaps; for many of the Fragments are utterly desti-
<lb break="no"/>tute of intrinsic value, and have no other interest than what ap-
<lb break="no"/>pertains to them as relics of Shelley. The Biographical and Crit-
<lb break="no"/>ical Notice by Mr. Foster, is well written, (barring a little justi-
<lb break="no"/>fiable furore) and evinces a keen discrimination, and, very espe-
<lb break="no"/>cially, a thorough appreciation of the excellences of the subject of
<lb/>the memoir. We shall be pardoned for copying some passages
<lb/>embodying Mr. Foster’s opinions on “The Revolt of Islam”
<lb/>and affording, also, a fair specimen of his style:</p>
                <p>The “Revolt of Islam,” although not admitted by the critics to
<lb/>be his grandest work, is, in the meaning I attach to poetry, alto-
<lb break="no"/>gether the most important. It is, as it were, the consummation of
<lb/>himself—the prophecy which he has uttered; and although it con-
<lb break="no"/>tained still more literary errors than have been charged upon it, yet
<lb/>in this view they would not detract from the importance of it. But
<lb/>these errors are, for the most part, mere distortions of the critics’
<lb/>brains, and do not deserve seriously to be alleged against a man who
<lb/>has shown his right to disregard the apparent and mechanical laws
<lb/>of poetry, by proving that he has held living communion with the
<lb/>source whence those laws have been attempted to be drawn. Au-
<lb break="no"/>tumn is a faulty colorist, by all the rules of Dilettantism—and yet
<lb/>we do not criticise, but admire her pictures. Language is at best
<lb/>but a dull instrument for Thought to work withal; and if Shelley
<lb/>has succeeded in producing, as a whole, deeper effects and more
<lb/>beautiful pictures than others, we will not quarrel with him because
<lb/>his instinct has developed rules of composition of which our critical
<lb/>scholarship happened to be ignorant: the great bard of Avon has
<lb/>been quite annihilated by the critics several times; and yet we have
<lb/>even forgotten their names, long ago, while we every day bring fresh
<lb/>worship to his altar—which bears not even a mark of all the critics’
<lb/>well-filed teeth that have ever nibbled at its base.</p>
                <p>The “Revolt of Islam” is written in twelve cantos of Spenserian
<lb/>stanzas, and was at first to have been called “Laon and Cythna.”</p>
                <p>*******</p>
                <p>Bold as it is in many of the sentiments, it is a noble monument to
<lb/>the loftiness of his aims, the brilliancy of his imagination, the
<lb/>wealth of love in his heart, and the breadth and power of his intel-
<lb break="no"/>lect It is an armory from which the young enthusiasts of many
<lb/>generations to come may draw their weapons, in the assurance that
<lb/>they are of tried temper and exquisite polish. We have never read
<lb/>it without feeling our souls stirred within us as with the sound of a
<lb/>trumpet—it has enlarged our thoughts, expanded and warmed our
<lb/>affections, quickened our purposes of good, and filled us with an
<lb/>unquenchable flame of philanthropy and love. It is almost the only
<lb/>poem that we can read at all seasons. In those darker moments,
<lb/>when the sense of misdirected efforts, or the exhaustion of disease,
<lb/>or the dark and mysterious dread oi some future ill, weighs like an
<lb/>incubus upon the soul, it is almost the only work, after the gospels,
<lb/>that furnishes nutriment and solace to our mind. Then, it touches
<lb/>us with a feeling of universal sympathy. It awakens us to the
<lb/>broad, deep sorrows of the world, it quickens languid and lagging
<lb/>resolutiens, it confirms our faith in good, and swells our hearts with
<lb/>high and bursting hopes. Oh sweet, incomprehensibly sweet, are
<lb/>the emotions of intense and burning enthusiosm that it kindles!</p></div>

                <p>Through neglect, discourtesy, or something else, on the part of

<lb/>attention is especially arrested by Miss Anne C. Lynch’s
<lb/>thoughtful and vigorous poem,</p>
                <lg><head>BONES IN THE DESERT.</head>
<l>Where plgrims seek the Prophet’s tomb</l>
<l>Across the Arabian waste,</l>
<l>Upon the ever shifting sands,</l>
<l>A fearful path is traced.</l>
<l>Far up to the horizon’s verge,</l>
<l>The traveler sees it rise,</l>
<l>A line of ghastly bones that bleach</l>
<l>Beneath those burning skies.</l>
<l>Across it, tempest and simoom</l>
<l>The desert sands have strewed,</l>
<l>But still that line of spectral white</l>
<l>Forever is renewed.</l>
<l>For while along that burning track</l>
<l>The caravans move on,</l>
<l>Still do the way-worn pilgrims fall,</l>
<l>Ere yet the shrine be won.</l>
<l>There the tired camel lays him down</l>
<l>And shuts his gentle eyes,</l>
<l>And there the fiery rider droops,</l>
<l>Toward Mecca looks and dies.</l>
<l>They fall unheeded from the ranks:—</l>
<l>On sweeps the endless train,</l>
<l>But there to mark the desert path</l>
<l>Their whitening bones remain.</l>
<l>As thus I read the mournful tale</l>
<l>Upon the traveler’s page,</l>
<l>I thought how like the march of life</l>
<l>Is this sad pilgrimage.</l>
<l>For every heart hath some fair dream,</l>
<l>Some object unattained,</l>
<l>And far off in the distance lies</l>
<l>Some Mecca to be gained.</l>
<l>But beauty, manhood, love and power</l>
<l>Go in their morning down,</l>
<l>And longing eyes and outstretched arms</l>
<l>Tell of the goal unwon.</l>
<l>The mighty caravan of life</l>
<l>Above their dust may sweep,</l>
<l>Nor shout, nor trampling feet shall break</l>
<l>The rest of those who sleep.</l>
<l>Oh, fountains that I have not reached,</l>
<l>That gush far off e’en now,</l>
<l>When shall I quench my spirit’s thirst</l>
<l>Where your sweet waters flow?</l>
<l>Oh, Mecca of my life-long dreams,</l>
<l>Cloud-palaces that rise</l>
<l>In that far distance pierced by hope,</l>
<l>When will ye greet mine eyes?</l><cb n="2"/>

                <p>Miscellanies, by William H. Prescott. New York: Harper &amp;
<lb/>Brothers.</p>
                <p>We said a few words, last week, of this admirable collection
<lb/>of essays, and now take the liberty of extracting some portion of
<lb/>the interesting paper on the genius of Brockden Brown:</p>
                <p>The explication of the mysteries of Wieland naturally suggests
<lb/>the question how far an author is bound to explain the supernatu-
<lb break="no"/>ralities, if we may so call them, of his fictions; and whether it is
<lb/>not better, on the whole, to trust to the willing superstition
<lb/>and credulity of the reader (of which there is perhaps store
<lb/>enough in almost every bosom, at the present enlightened day
<lb/>even, for poetical purposes) than to attempt a solution on purely
<lb/>natural or mechanical principles. It was thought no harm for the
<lb/>ancients to bring the use of machinery into their epics, and a simi-
<lb break="no"/>lar freedom was conceded to the old English dramatists, whose
<lb/>ghosts and witches were placed in the much more perilous predica-
<lb break="no"/>ment of being subjected to the scrutiny of the spectator, whose
<lb/>senses are not near so likely to be duped as the sensitive and excited
<lb/>imagination of the reader in his solitary chamber. It must be ad-
<lb break="no"/>mitted, however, that the public of those days, when the
                              <lg><l>Undoubting mind</l>
           <l>Believed the magic wonders that were sung,</l></lg>
<lb/>were admirably seasoned for the action of superstition in all forms,
<lb/>and furnished, therefore, a most enviable audience for the melo-
<lb break="no"/>dramatic artist, whether dramatist or romance-writer. But all this
<lb/>is changed. No witches ride the air now-a-days, and fairies no
<lb/>longer “dance their rounds by the pale moonlight,” as the worthy
<lb/>Bishop Corbet, indeed, lamented a century and a half ago.</p>
                <p>Still it may be allowed, perhaps, if the scene is laid in some re-
<lb break="no"/>mote age or country, to borrow the ancient superstitions of the place
<lb/>and incorporate them into, or, at least, color the story with them,
<lb/>without shocking the well-bred prejudices of the modern reader.
<lb/>Sir Walter Scott has done this with good effect in more than one of
<lb/>his romances, as every one will readily call to mind. A fine exam-
<lb break="no"/>ple occurs in the Boden Glas apparition in Waverley, which the
<lb/>great novelist, far from attempting to explain on any philosophical
<lb/>principles, or even by an intimation of its being the mere creation
<lb/>of a feverish imagination, lias left as he found it, trusting that the
<lb/>reader’s poetic feeling will readily accommodate itself to the popular
<lb/>superstitions of the country he is depicting. This reserve on his
<lb/>part, indeed, arising from a truly poetic view of the subject, and
<lb/>an honest reliance on a similar spirit in his reader, has laid him
<lb/>open, with some matter-of-fact people, to the imputation of not
<lb/>being wholly untouched himself by the national superstitions. Yet
<lb/>how much would the whole scene have lost in its permanent effect
<lb/>if the author had attempted an explanation of the apparition on the
<lb/>ground of an optical illusion not infrequent among the mountain
<lb/>mists of the Highlands, or any other of the ingenious solutions so
<lb/>readily at the command of the thorough-bred story-teller!</p>
                <p>It must be acknowledged, however, that this way of solving the
<lb/>riddles of romance would hardly be admissible in a story drawn
<lb/>from familiar scenes and situations in modern life, and especially in
<lb/>our own country. The lights of education are flung too bright and
<lb/>broad over the land to allow any lurking-hole for the shadows of a
<lb/>twilight age. So much the worse for the poet and the novelist
<lb/>Their province must now be confined to poor human nature, with-
<lb break="no"/>out meddling with the “Gorgons and chimeras dire” which floated
<lb/>through the bewildered brains of our forefathers, at least on the
<lb/>other aide of the water. At any rate, if a writer, in this broad sun<pb n="387"/><cb n="1"/>
<lb/>shine, ventures on any sort of diablerie he is forced to explain it by
<lb/>all the thousand contrivances of trap-doors, secret passages, waxen
<lb/>images, and other make-shifts from the property-room of Mrs. Rad-
<lb break="no"/>cliffe and Company.</p>
                <p>Brown, indeed, has resorted to a somewhat higher mode of eluci-
<lb break="no"/>dating his mysteries by a remarkable phenomenon of our nature.
<lb/>But the misfortune of all these attempts to account for the marvels
<lb/>of the story by natural or mechanical causes is, that they are very
<lb/>seldom satisfactory, or competent to their object. This is emi-
<lb break="no"/>nently the case with the ventriloquism in Wieland. Even where
<lb/>they are competent, it may be doubted whether the reader, who has
<lb/>suffered his credulous fancy to be entranced by the spell of the
<lb/>magician, will be gratified to learn, at the end, by what cheap me-
<lb break="no"/>chanical contrivance he has been duped. However this may be, it
<lb/>is certain that a very unfavorable effect, in another respect, is pro-
<lb break="no"/>duced on his mind, after he is made acquainted with the nature of
<lb/>the secret spring by which the machinery is played, more especially
<lb/>when one leading circumstance, like ventriloquism in Wieland, is
<lb/>made the master-key, as it were, by which all the mysteries are to
<lb/>be unlocked and opened at once. With this explanation at hand,
<lb/>it is extremely difficult to rise to that sensation of mysterious awe
<lb/>and apprehension on which so much of the sublimity and general
<lb/>effect of the narrative necessarily depends. Instead of such feelings,
<lb/>the only ones which can enable us to do full justice to the author’s
<lb/>conceptions, we sometimes, on the contrary, may detect a smile
<lb/>lurking in the corner of the mouth, as we peruse scenes of positive
<lb/>power, from the contrast obviously suggested of the impotence of
<lb/>the apparatus and the portentous character of the results. The
<lb/>critic, therefore, possessed of the real key to the mysteries of the
<lb/>story, if he would do justice to his author’s merits, must divest
<lb/>himself, as it were, of his previous knowledge, by fastening his
<lb/>attention on the results, to the exclusion of the insignificant means
<lb/>by which they are achieved. He will not always find this an easy
<lb/>matter.</p></div>

                <p>The Poems of Alfred B. Street. Complete Edition. New York:
<lb/>Clark &amp; Austin.</p>
                <p>Most of the poems here included, are familiar friends, and we
<lb/>cordially welcome their re-appearance. A modest Preface says:</p>
                <p>The early life of the author was spent in a wild and picturesque re-
<lb break="no"/>gion in the southwestern part of New York—his native state. Apart
<lb/>from the busy haunts of mankind, his eye was caught by the strongly
<lb/>marked and beautiful scenes by which he was surrounded: and to the
<lb/>first impressions thus made may be attributed the fact that his subjects
<lb/>relate so much to Nature and so little to Man. Instead, therefore, of
<lb/>aiming to depict the human heart, he has endeavored to sketch (how-
<lb break="no"/>ever rudely and imperfectly) the features of that with which he was
<lb/>most familiar.</p>
                <p>These are the impulsive words of a true poet. Man is, in fact,
<lb/>only incidentally a poetic theme:—we mean the heart and intel-
<lb break="no"/>lect of Man—matters which the pseudo-transcendentalists of
<lb/>Frogpondium are perpetually attempting to force into poetry—
<lb/>with no other object than to impart to their doggrel an air of pro-
<lb break="no"/>fundity.</p>
                <p>Mr. Street’s subjects are invariably poetical ones—but they
<lb/>belong not to the loftiest order. They are descriptive altogether—
<lb/>not sufficiently ideal. Mr. Bryant seems to have been the model
<lb/>—although the Beauty of Nature may have been the inspiration.</p>
                <p>The volume is a very handsome octavo of 319 pages, and does
<lb/>credit to the taste and liberality of the publishers.</p></div>

                <p>Hyperion, a Romance. By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
<lb/>Second Edition, Cambridge: John Owen.</p>
                <p>This is one of the most tastefully printed books we have seen
<lb/>for many a year:—a thick duodecimo of 370 pages—delightful
<lb/>type, unusually good paper—well bound. The work itself is
<lb/>sufficiently well known. It has all Mr. Longfellow’s distinctive-<cb n="2"/>
<lb break="no"/>ness of thought and manner—is graceful, scholar-like, at times
<lb/>pointed, and always artistical, but neither original, nor very inter-
<lb break="no"/>estiing. Its tone is a palpable imitation of the German spirit. One
<lb/>of its marked peculiarities—and an idiosyncrasy, in fact, apper-
<lb break="no"/>taining to all that the author does—is its entire want of suggest-
<lb break="no"/>iveness. The book does not go beyond itself Mr. Longfellow’s
<lb/>works seem to some minds greater than they are, on account of
<lb/>their perfection of finish—on account of the thoroughness with
<lb/>which their designs are carried out. They exhaust limited sub-
<lb break="no"/>jects. His books are books and no more. Those of men of ge-
<lb break="no"/>nius ate books and a dream to boot. These men do not exhaust
<lb/>their subjects, because their subjects expand with every touch.
<lb/>The volume is for sale in New York by D. Appleton &amp; Co.</p></div>

                <p>Wiley &amp; Putnam's Library of American Books. No. 10. The
<lb/>Alps and the Rhine. By J. T. Headley.</p>
                <p>This is one of the most entertaining books yet issued in the
<lb/>American series. The vivacity and blilliant fancy of Headley
<lb/>throw a charm over all his descriptions—a charm that has all the
<lb/>effect of novelty—if indeed it is not.</p>
                <p>A marked peculiarity of the author is the Irishy abandon or
<lb/>neck-or-nothingness of his manner. He writes as if he held it a
<lb/>sin to keep us waiting a moment—either for grammar or any
<lb/>thing else.</p>
                <p>“I have never felt” says his Preface “the need of stronger
<lb/>Saxon more than when standing amid the chaos of an Alpine
<lb/>abyss or looking off from the summit of an Alpine peak. Like
<lb/>the attempt to utter a man’s deepest emotions, words for the time
<lb/>shock him.”</p>
                <p>Why “off?”—is not “from” enough? The “summit of a
<lb/>peak” is something, we presume, like the end of an extremity.
<lb/>As for the subsequent sentence, we give it up.</p>
                <p>Mr. Headley is only committing a very common error, we
<lb/>think, in saying: “We get a definite idea of very few things in
<lb/>the world we have never seen, by mere naked details”—etc., etc.</p>
                <p>Here we are forced to say, imprimis, that Mr. H. has really no
<lb/>reference to things in the world we have never seen—but to
<lb/>things in the world we have seen. It is not the grammatical con-
<lb break="no"/>struction of the sentence, however, but its philosophy to which
<lb/>we allude. When details fail to convey distinct impressions, it
<lb/>is merely because the details themselves are indistinct. But all this
<lb/>is hypercriticism:—the book is an admirable book, and Mr.
<lb/>Headley is an admirable man.</p></div>

<lb/>Smillie,—subject Washington at Princeton. There is also a
<lb/>plate of Fashions—two figures—the whole well-drawn, well

<lb/>Fanny Forrester, Lowell, Eames, Street, Brooks, Chivers, and
<lb/>others. Lowell has a poem full of nerve and grace. Here is a
<lb/>magnificent stanza:</p>

<lg><l>Titanic shapes, with faces blank and dun,</l>
<l>Of their old Godhead born,</l>
<l>Gaze on the embers of the sunken sun,</l>
<l>Which they misdeem for morn;</l>
<l>And yet the eternal sorrow</l>
<l>In their unmonarched eyes says day is done,</l>
<l>Without the hope of morrow.</l><cb n="2"/>
<l>And here a melodious one :</l>
<l>Here, ’mid the bleak waves of our strife and care</l>
<l>Float the green Fortunate Isles,</l>
<l>Where all our hero spirits dwell, and share</l>
<l>Our martyrdoms and toils;</l>

<lb/>is strongly tinctured with imitation. For example:</p>
                      
<lg><l>The dappled fawns upon the plains,</l>
<l>The birds that love the upper sky</l>

                    <p>On Monday evening, we saw Mr. Murdoch’s impersonation of
<lb/>Hamlet; and we are surely not mistaken when we say it was Mr.
<lb/>Murdoch’s, for certainly he has drawn on no living actor for any
<lb/>peculiarity of style or manner in his acting of Hamlet. At the
<lb/>raising of the curtain he was received with the stormiest applause
<lb/>we ever saw or heard.</p>
                    <p>It must have been a moment of intense anxiety, and almost of
<lb/>overwhelming feeling. Surrounded by warm friends and admirers,
<lb/>he must have been tried to his utmost “beat.” He was to cast a
<lb/>new die, and upon its issue depended his fate as an actor; appearing
<lb/>in a new character, he must have been suspended between hope and
<lb/>fear to their maddest verge. Through the first and second acts, we
<lb/>thought he faltered, and seemed oppressed by personal feeling; but
<lb/>often in the second act he broke through its fetters, and threw his
<lb/>whole soul into the character. The closing words of this act were
<lb/>delivered with more triumphant power than we ever had heard
<lb/>them before. When he exclaimed
                    
                   <lg><l>The play’s the thing</l>
<l>Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king,</l></lg>

<lb/>we were then fully satisfied that Murdoch was equal to the task he
<lb/>had undertaken; he had fallen upon a stratagem that would foil the
<lb/>subtil king, and enmesh him in his own conscience, and it gleamed
<lb/>from every nerve in the actor. The soliloquy commencing with
<lb/>‘‘To be, or not to be,” was read with as fine an appreciation of all
<lb/>the great and pregnant questions therein as we ever heard it, not
<lb/>excepting even by the elder Kean.</p>
                    <p>His conception of that part of this drama, we mean his treatment
<lb/>of Ophelia, was more in accordance with our own views than has
<lb/>been portrayed by any recent actor, unless Macready. Through his
<lb/>rigor towards her there seemed to beam a gentleness and affection
<lb/>truly admirable.</p>
                    <p>In the dialogue between himself and mother, when he shows the

                    <p>On Wednesday evening, Mr. Murdoch appeared in the character
<lb/>of Benedick in that delightful comedy of Shakspeare’s, “Much
<lb/>Ado About Nothing.” We never saw him in a fitter mood. He
<lb/>threw an irresistible charm and fascination over the part, which
<lb/>would have satisfied even the fancy of Shakspeare, had he been
<lb/>present. All the grace, sprightliness and elegance of a high order
<lb/>of acting were here exhibited, and we do not believe there is a
<lb/>better Benedick on the stage. We feel highly gratified to see his
<lb/>exquisite taste in a wardrobe, and its richness and brilliancy are
<lb/>unsurpassed.—Daily Times.</p></div>

                    <p>Mr. Murdoch was truly successful in the character of Claude.
<lb/>By nature he is eminently qualified to perform this part. He has
<lb/>all that exuberance of spirits, that overflowing warmth of heart,
<lb/>which so well become this humble but aspiring young man, as de-
<lb break="no"/>picted by the pen of Bulwer. In voice and action we readily and
<lb/>spontaneously exclaim, how “express and admirable.” There is
<lb/>one charm in the acting of Mr. Murdoch which we could not over-
<lb break="no"/>look; it is the manner in which he constantly wins upon his audi-
<lb break="no"/>tors. He never abates or falls off in fascination, but spell after
<lb/>spell comes upon them, produced by the witchery of his genius.</p>
                    <p>We say “genius,” and that after full reflection. An actor who
<lb/>could thrill the house as he did, near the close of the fourth act,
<lb/>must be possessed of powers of the first order. It was no idle
<lb/>declamation, but the outpouring of a heart, strung to the highest
<lb/>pitch of human passion. He went through the last act with power
<lb/>and effect. Some passages of the reading were jewels in them-
<lb break="no"/>selves; his picture of his palace was described in the finest orato-
<lb break="no"/>rical voice we ever heard.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Murdoch's Claude Melnotte is emphatically a fine specimen
<lb/>of acting; and we are confident that hereafter, before a Boston
<lb/>audience, he will stand unsurpassed as the representative of that
<lb/>character.—Evening Transcript.</p></div>

                    <p>Mr. Murdoch’s Othello.—The announcement of Mr. Murdoch
<lb/>in the difficult character of Othello, on Thursday evening, drew
<lb/>together a very large and fashionable audience to the Athenaeum.</p>
                    <p>Taken as a whole, Mr. M’s delineation of the character was fine
<lb/>and impressive, and drew down frequent and enthusiastic applause.
<lb/>In the earlier parts of the play the tragedian was somewhat re-
<lb break="no"/>served; and his address to the senate lacked dignity and force.
<lb/>But with this scene closed our dissent from his conception and
<lb/>delineation. The midnight brawl, rousing the soldier like a trumpet
<lb/>from his sleep, seemed to awaken all the fire and fervor of the actor.
<lb/>From that moment he gave himself up to the tide of stormy pas-
<lb break="no"/>sion—of alternate tenderness and hate—doubt and doting—suspi-
<lb break="no"/>cion, revenge and despair, that make up one of the most terribly
<lb/>truthful characters drawn by the pen of the great dramatist. The
<lb/>rapid darkling of the noble nature of the Moor—the swift circula-
<lb break="no"/>tion of the poison instilled by the serpent—the fearful menaces—
<lb/>the wavering purposes—the gathered gloom—the fell revenge, and
<lb/>the despair more fell yet, of the ruined and betrayed lover and hus-
<lb break="no"/>band, flashed from the eyes, gestures, attitudes and tears of the actor
<lb/>to the hearts and minds of the entire audience. The furious charge
<lb/>to Iago—
                      <lg><l>Villain! be sure thou prov’st my love is false,</l></lg>

<lb/>mona—
                      
                      <lg><l> Excellent wench, &amp;c.,</l></lg>
                      
<lb/>the heart-broken farewell to all the “pomp, pride and circumstance
<lb/>of glorious war,” the mingled tenderness, sternness and ruthless-
<lb break="no"/>ness of the murder scene, and the terrible expiation of the crime,
<lb/>were all the most critical could demand. We know not what future
<lb/>triumphs Mr. Murdoch has in store, but if he surpasses his
<lb/>“Othello,” he will indeed enact wonders.—Times.</p></div></div><pb n="390"/><cb n="1"/>

                      <p>Mr. Burke’s Concert, on Tuesday evening last, was attended
<lb/>by a most fashionable audience. We have heard the gentleman
<lb/>before, but under such disadvantages that we declined giving an
<lb/>opinion. We can now safely pronounce him one of the best
<lb/>violinists that we have ever heard in this country. His tone is
<lb/>solid and marrowy, his bowing is perfect from the mere saltando
<lb/>to the staccato, in every manner and shape. He was encored
<lb/>after every piece, but declined repeating the Capriccio by Vieux
<lb/>Temps, on account of too great previous exertion.</p>                      
                      <p>We cannot say that we are so exceedingly delighted with the
<lb/>singing of either Mrs. Andrews or Mr. Zander. Mrs. A. has a
<lb/>quite peculiar voice, or rather half-a-dozen of them combined in
<lb/>one. Such variety is at times pleasing, but we did not find it so
<lb/>in either of the pieces which the lady selected. A peculiar turn
<lb/>was introduced by her at every single cadence, and we regret
<lb/>exceedingly not having any music type at our command, that we
<lb/>might have given it (the turn) to our readers. “Mr. L. T. Zan-
<lb break="no"/>der, Vocalist from Boston,” announces on the bill his first appear-
<lb break="no"/>ance in this city. We hope it may be his last.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Burke introduced in his Melange Brillante all the popular
<lb/>airs of the day, such as Yankee Doodle, Dandy Jim, Lucy Long,
<lb/>etc. During the performance of the last, which, by the bye,
<lb/>had a great deal of bowing, the wire on the G string got loose,
<lb/>and a passage in Harmonics was spoiled. Many of the audience
<lb/>expressed their regret at this accident, at the end of the perform-
<lb break="no"/>ance. “There is one consolation,” he observed, “it is not the
<lb/>only break down in the piece.” Mr. Burke seems to possess a
<lb/>good-humor, which, combined with his extraordinary talent,
<lb/>cannot fail to win him hosts of friends and admirers. He goes
<lb/>to Boston to-morrow, and will return to this city by the 19th of
<lb/>January, when he will play at the Philharmonic Concert.</p></div><cb n="2"/>

                       <p>Dr. Collier, the eminent Mesmerist, has written to us in refer-

                       <p>Boston, December 16,1845.</p>
                       <p>Dear Sir—Your account of M. Valdemar’s Case has been uni-
<lb break="no"/>versally copied in this city, and has created a very great sensation.
<lb/>It requires from me no apology, in stating, that I have not the least
<lb/>doubt of the possibility of such-a phenomenon; for, I did actually
<lb/>restore to active animation a person who died from excessive drink-
<lb break="no"/>ing of ardent spirits. He was placed in his coffin ready for interment.</p>
                       <p>You are aware that death very often follows excessive excite-
<lb break="no"/>ment of the nervous system; this arising from the extreme pros-
<lb break="no"/>tration which follows; so that the vital powers have not sufficient
<lb/>energy to react.</p>
                       <p>I will give you the detailed account on your reply to this, which
<lb/>I require for publication, in order to put at rest the growing impres-
<lb break="no"/>sion that your account is merely a splendid creation of your own
<lb/>brain, not having any truth in fact. My dear sir, I have battled the
<lb/>storm of public derision too long on the subject of Mesmerism, to
<lb/>be now found in the rear ranks—though I have not publicly lectured
<lb/>for more than two years, I have steadily made it a subject of deep
<lb/>investigation.</p>
                       <p>I sent the account to my friend Dr. Elliotson of London ; also to
<lb/>the “Zoist,”—to which journal I have regularly contributed.</p>
                       <p>Your early reply will oblige, which I will publish, with your
<lb/>consent, in connection with the case I have referred to. Believe
<lb/>me yours, most respectfully,</p>

<lb/>that he says—and all that he desires us to say—but the truth is,
<lb/>there was a very small modicum of truth in the case of
<lb/>M. Valdemar—which, in consequence, may be called a hard
<lb/>case—very hard for M. Valdemar, for Mr. Collyer, and ourselves.
<lb/>If the story was not true, however, it should have been—and

                       <p>The Daily News—Speaking of Dickens’ projected paper, thus
<lb/>entitled, the correspondent of the Liverpool Chronicle says:</p>
                       <p>I told you some time ago, if I recollect aright, that a new daily
<lb/>paper of ultra liberal politics was to be started, with Charles
<lb/>Dickens as the editor, and his father as field marshal or conductor.
<lb/>Messrs. Bradbury and Evans, the proprietors of Punch, are the
<lb/>spirited men ostensibly known in the new paper—that is to be.
<lb/>A number of “crack” reporters, all short-hand men, of the metro-
<lb break="no"/>politan journals, have been engaged, at salaries of seven, eight
<lb/>and ten guineas a-week, for three years certain. Dickens is to have
<lb/>two thousand a year! Jerrold, Mark Lemon, and others of “mark”
<lb/>and “likelihood,” are to be among the chief writers. There is
<lb/>plenty of cash in bank, and the parties are all men of undoubted
<lb/>honor. After a little “hitch,” the effects of which lasted only
<lb/>twenty-four hours, everything has gone on cheeringly. Charles
<lb/>Dickens had a dinner party the other day, composed of the principal
<lb/>lads engaged; each gentleman invited had come with six names for
<lb/>the future journal: after dinner these were discussed with the
<lb/>champagne and claret; some of the titles were funny enough, and
<lb/>your readers must lose a good laugh by my withholding them. By-
<lb break="no"/>general consent, “The Daily News” was adopted. The paper is
<lb/>to be a rival of the old Whig Morning Chronicle.</p>
                       <p>A capital of £100,000 was required to commence operations—
<lb/>so great, in England, is the risk and difficulty of establishing a
<lb/>daily paper. The first number will be issued on the first day of
<lb/>the new year. Among the collaborators is “an American gen-
<lb break="no"/>tleman who has acquired much note as a Magazinist,”—possibly
<lb/>John Neal.</p></div>

                       <p>The Boston Post says:</p>
                       <p>We have just learned of a most flattering compliment that has
<lb/>been recently paid by a crowned head of Europe to an American
<lb/>writer, Mr. A. J. Downing, of Highland Gardens, New York, who
<lb/>published, not long since, a most charming book on landscape
<lb/>gardening. Mr. Henry Wikoff, who arrived yesterday in the
<lb/>Acadia, from Liverpool, has brought over with him an autograph
<lb/>letter from the Queen of Holland, together with a magnificent ruby
<lb/>ring encircled by three rows of fine diamonds, in acknowledgment
<lb/>of the pleasure she had derived from the late perusal of Mr. Down-
<lb break="no"/>ing’s book. A compliment like this from a royal personage to an
<lb/>American author is certainly quite novel, and what enhances its
<lb/>value is the new mode made choice of. The gift of a jewel is the
<lb/>familiar form that a crowned head usually selects to express royal
<lb/>approbation, but it is the first instance of the kind we know of
<lb/>where an autograph letter was added to give a stronger emphasis to<cb n="2"/>
<lb/>such a testimonial. We record with great pleasure this marked
<lb/>compliment to the talents of a fellow countryman, and congratulate
<lb/>Mr. Wikoff upon his honorable commission.</p>
                       <p>For our own parts we are glad that Mr. Downing has received
<lb/>the ring—especially as it consists of diamonds and rubies and
<lb/>has, therefore, much intrinsic value. We use the words “in-
<lb break="no"/>trinsic value” not rigorously, but in distinction from the facti-
<lb break="no"/>tious value which, in the public eye, appertains to the present as
<lb/>that of a monarch—and which in our own sincere opinion is pre-
<lb break="no"/>cisely nothing at all—unless, indeed, we are to understand that
<lb/>the individual monarch, in this case, is a very especial judge of
<lb/>the merits of a work on “Landscape Gardening.” What we
<lb/>mean to say, is simply this:—that the value of any approbation,
<lb/>or any testimony of approbation, for a book, is in the ratio not
<lb/>of the worldly eminence, but in that of the judgment and good
<lb/>faith of the person who commends.</p></div>

                       <head type="supplied">The Boston Courier</head>
                       <p>The Boston Courier says:</p>
                       <p>It is with deepest regret that we learn the death of Mrs. Maria
<lb/>Brooks, the authoress of “Zophiel.” She died on the 11th of Nov.
<lb/>last, at Matanzas, in the island of Cuba, from the debility conse-
<lb break="no"/>quent upon a severe fit of sickness. Mrs. Brooks was, at the time
<lb/>of her decease, about fifty years old. She was born at Medford, in
<lb/>this state, and for a considerable period resided in this city. About
<lb/>fifteen years ago she visited France and England, and while there
<lb/>formed many friendships with distinguished persons in both
<lb/>countries, among others with Lafayette, Wordsworth, and Southey.
<lb/>Of late years she has resided principally in Matanzas.</p>
                       <p>Mrs. Brooks was one of the most remarkable women that ever
<lb/>lived. To great attainments in literature, she joined a powerful and
<lb/>original genius, and a character of singular energy and individuality.
<lb/>Both in England and the United States, she has been considered by
<lb/>all who have read her writings thoughtfully, as unmatched among
<lb/>poets of her sex. Southey, who superintended the publication of
<lb/>her “Zophiel,” had the most exalted opinion of her powers, and
<lb/>pronounced her “the most impassioned and imaginative of all
<lb/>poetesses.” When “Zophiel” was published, Charles Lamb wrote
<lb/>to a friend, that Southey was trying to pass off the poem as the pro-
<lb break="no"/>duction of an American woman, as if, he said, “there ever was a
<lb/>woman capable of writing such a poem.” This is high praise, but
<lb/>it is borne out by the poem itself. It is one of the few compositions
<lb/>written during the present century, destined for durable fame. It
<lb/>is one of the most original, passionate and harmonious works of im-
<lb break="no"/>agination ever conceived—and there breathes through the whole the
<lb/>vital life of genius. Though it has not been extensively circulated
<lb/>in the United States, there are very few American productions
<lb/>which shed so much glory on our literature, or which are so often
<lb/>quoted abroad as evidences of American genius.</p>
                       <p>That a mind of so much power and brilliancy should have depart-
<lb break="no"/>ed—that one of the lights of our literature should have been
<lb/>quenched, we consider an occasion for the most sincere regret. But
<lb/>the image of that mind, stamped on her productions, will not de-
<lb break="no"/>part. The light that illumines the records of her genius will not
<lb/>be quenched. Her memory will never return to the dust; her
<lb/>mind, even on earth, will have no grave and no tomb. Silently and
<lb/>surely her genius will work its way into the great public heart of
<lb/>the country, and her fame grow with time. And we cannot con-
<lb break="no"/>ceive of the period when an American, in reviewing the causes
<lb/>which have conducted to place his country in a proud intellectual
<lb/>position, and assisted in giving to it the immortality which springs
<lb/>from literature, shall cease to regard with peculiar gratitude and ad-
<lb break="no"/>miration the name of the authoress of “Zophiel.”</p>
                       <p>The critic who writes this is somewhat given to excess of en-
<lb break="no"/>thusiasm, and we certainly are very far from agreeing with him
<lb/>in his opinion that Mrs. Brooks was “considered by all who
<lb/>have read her writings thoughtfully as unmatched among poets
<lb/>of her sex.” The author of “Zophiel” was a truly imaginative
<lb/>poet, but no one, “who read her writings thoughtfully,” would<pb n="392"/><cb n="1"/>
<lb/>think of comparing her with Miss Barrett—or even with Mrs.
<lb/>Norton. As for Lamb’s pert query—“was there ever a woman
<lb/>capable of writing such a poem ?”—it merely proves that Lamb
<lb/>had little understanding of the true nature of Poetry—which, ap-
<lb break="no"/>pealing especially to our sense of Beauty, is, in its very essence,
<lb/>feminine. If the greatest poems have not been written by wo-
<lb break="no"/>men, it is because, as yet, the greatest poems have not been writ-
<lb break="no"/>ten at all.</p></div>

<lg><l>“Einst ist die Lieben.”</l>
<l>Who goes so late through wind and night,</l>
<l>With joyous face and beaming eye,</l>
<l>His step so firm, his heart so light?</l>
<l>Means he, with light guitar, Love’s fate to try?</l>
<l>Ah, youthful bard, trust not the fair!</l>
<l>Their hearts are ever false and vain;</l>
<l>Trust not thine eyes, nor bend thine ear!</l>
<l>Heed not their song, nor wake thy strain!</l>
<l>For woman’s heart will triumph in thy pain.</l>
<l>Away false Doubt! the youth replies,</l>
<l>Damp not thus my soul with sorrow—</l>
<l>True love from thee forever flies—</l>
<l>Thy gloomy past shall be my morrow;</l>
<l>My heart, from thee, no grief shall borrow.</l><cb n="2"/>
<l>Thus spoke the bard, then woke the lay;</l>
<l>To one he sang, whom Love had given</l>
<l>Again to make men bless the day,</l>
<l>When first he stole to Earth from Heaven,</l>
<l>While joined in her, all grace seemed brighter even.</l>
<l>Now on the winds his sighings rise;</l>
<l>Beneath the lattice sings the Boy,</l>
<l>And upwards turns his tender eyes;</l>
<l>Rise sweetest hopes, and welcome joy,</l>
<l>While thus Love’s songs the gentle hours employ.</l>
<l>But pleads the fond Minstrel in vain</l>
<l>To her heart cold and unfeeling,</l>
<l>Like that grim lake on Italy’s plain</l>
<l>Itself’s waters all concealing</l>
<l>Sinks in the grave its own waves die sealing.</l>
<l>Now colder blew the midnight blast,</l>
<l>Hoarse peal the bells in sullen toll,</l>
<l>The driven snow falls round him fast,</l>
<l>And fly the hopes that filled his soul,</l>
<l>Like the dark clouds that swiftly o’er him roll.</l>
<l>Through the tall and quaint old trees</l>
<l>Down sheds the light its mellowed gleam;</l>
<l>Like silvery moonlit seas,</l>
<l>Or diamond’s glittering beam,</l>
<l>Their snow-hung branches round him shining seem.</l>
<l>Two starry tears in silence fall,</l>
<l>Congealed they fasten on the string</l>
<l>That woke so oft Love’s sweetest call—</l>
<l>No more for thee may lovers sing—</l>
<l>And dead the tones that told their suffering.</l></lg>

<lb/>DOCT. H. E. SCHOONMAKER, Dental Surgeon, Office, 446
<lb/>Houston st., two doors from Broadway—opposite St. Thomas’
<lb/>Church.
<lb/>Doct. S.’s experience and skill in his profession give him confi-
<lb break="no"/>dence in asserting that his operations are unsurpassed by any Den-
<lb break="no"/>tist in this city. Dr. S.’s manner of inserting artificial teeth varies
<lb/>in many essential points from the usual mode; and his success in
<lb/>pleasing all, he is happy to say, has brought him many difficult
<lb/>cases, which had been unsuccessfully treated by Dentists of estab-
<lb break="no"/>lished professional reputation, and whose prices for the same opera-
<lb break="no"/>tion were double his own. The object in inserting artificial teeth
<lb/>is to supply the deficiency occasioned by the loss of natural teeth,
<lb/>both in regard to utility, comfort in wearing, and natural appear-
<lb break="no"/>ance. In all these points, Dr. S.’s manner is pre-eminent. His
<lb/>mechanical tact and ingenuity have enabled him to surmount many
<lb/>obstacles, which have long, with the profession generally, impeded
<lb/>the path to success in every operation. He makes use of the best
<lb/>materials in all his operations—and in cases where the gum has
<lb/>fallen away by absorption, (which is always the case, more or less,
<lb/>when teeth have been extracted,) which causes a contraction of the
<lb/>lips and cheeks, the disfigurement of which cannot be fully obviated
<lb/>without adopting the artificial gums, which will supply the de-
<lb break="no"/>ficiency, and give to the mouth its usual redundancy—besides, their
<lb/>beauty and natural appearance render detection impossible.
<lb/>Dr. S. would be happy to refer those who require it, to many of
<lb/>the best families in this City, in which he has practised.
<lb/>Ladies who desire it, can have their teeth examined at their resi-
<lb/>dences, by sending their address as above.	nov8—9t</ab></div><cb n="2"/>

<lb/>Capt. Conolly.
<lb/>By the Rev. Joseph Wolff, LL.D.
<lb/>“This work has created a prodigious excitement throughout
<lb/>England; it is unique in its character, as a literary production. It
<lb/>seems to partake of the features of an autobiography; the narrative
<lb/>being full of personal detail, description of the perilous adventure
<lb/>and imminent hazard of the author, in his expedition through the
<lb/>East. No man living, perhaps, has traveled so extensively as this
<lb/>celebrated individual, and few could have contributed a more in-
<lb break="no"/>tensely interesting narrative of his experience.
<lb/>“It will thus be seen that this extraordinary and eccentric man
<lb/>is admirably qualified to present a transcript of Asiatic Character-
<lb break="no"/>istics,—supplying much that is novel and exceedingly curious about
<lb/>tribes and nations of which we know so little To say that the
<lb/>work is an acceptable addition to the library of travel, is affirming
<lb/>far too little of so striking a production: it is a book that ought to
<lb/>be read and deliberately enjoyed by every intelligent person, for its
<lb/>quaintness, freshness, and superabounding interest. The work is
<lb/>elegantly printed as a library book, and aderned by some dozen curi-
<lb break="no"/>ous fac-similes of oriental drawings.”—Courier and Enquirer.</ab></div><cb n="2"/>

<div><ab>THE SECOND VOLUME OF
<lb/>THE ARISTIDEAN:
<lb/>A JOURNAL OF REVIEWS, POLITICS, AND LIGHT LIT-
<lb break="no"/>ERATURE—By Thomas Dunn English, and numerous col-
<lb break="no"/>laborators—commences on the 20th of January, 1846.
<lb/>The Aristidean is published monthly, each number containing
<lb/>80 pages, octavo, printed on handsome white paper, with bold, clear
<lb/>type, at Five Dollars per annum, payable in advance.
<lb/>The aim of the editor has been to establish a Journal of Art and
<lb/>Letters, whose papers should be distinguished for force, vigor, sar-
<lb break="no"/>casm and pith, rather than an unutterable and bathetic profundity;
<lb/>one, which should not fear to expose literary quackery, and give to
<lb/>writers a proper precedence; one that had the moral courage to
<lb/>praise an enemy’s good works, and censure a friend’s bad ones; one
<lb/>that would maintain a rigorous independence on literary, political
<lb/>and religious matters; one that would attack all abuses without
<lb/>scruple; one that was insensible to fear, and deaf to favor; and one
<lb/>that depended for success on the merit of its papers, and not on the
<lb/>names announced as contributors. If the editor may judge from the
<lb/>high panegyric of the press, and the more substantial evidence of an
<lb/>increasing subscription list, he has succeeded in his intention.
<lb/>Those desiring to sustain an independent and fearless magazine
<lb/>will be kind enough to remit their subscriptions by mail, rather
<lb/>than through an agent.

<lb/>* Caution.—Large quantities of Hyson Skin are retailed in this
<lb/>market as being a Hyson Tea. It is well worth while to compare
<lb/>the Hyson Tea usually sold at 75 cents with the genuine article
<lb/>that the company offer at the same price. The difference is so per-
<lb break="no"/>ceptible, on trial, as to render any further comment unnecessary.
<lb/>Monstrous Fraud.—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be
<lb/>retailed by small dealers, in this country, at 75 cents per pound,
<lb/>because they frequently cost that money in China, and no Importer
<lb/>in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a less prica
<lb/>than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages. T. F. Davies,
<lb/>Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner in
<lb/>which he saw the lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured and
<lb/>colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpowder and
<lb/>Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a combination of
<lb/>Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poison. Let pur-
<lb break="no"/>chasers therefore beware of adulterated teas, and deal with those
<lb/>venders whose characters and resources raise them above suspicion.
<lb/>Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas retailed at 75 cents
<lb/>per pound, and compare them with the genuine article sold by the
<lb/>Pekin Tea Company. No one, it is presumed, wishes to drink
<lb/>poison. The company have published a book, giving full details on
<lb/>this subject, which may be had at their warehouse, 75 Fulton street,
<lb/>free of charge.
<lb/>Recommendations.
<lb/>We drink Green Tea, and for many years have been paying one
<lb/>dollar per pound for it. But thanks to the Pekin Tea Company, we
<lb/>now get a better tea from them at 75 cents per pound. We drink one
<lb/>pound per week, by which we are now saving thirteen dollars per year,
<lb/>and enjoying better tea in the bargain. Commend us to the Pekin Tea
<lb/>Company, say we.—[Mirror.
<lb/>The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, are performing a great
<lb/>and good work, and will, in a few years, beyond all doubt, drive all the
<lb/>poor teas which have deluged this country, and defrauded consumers
<lb/>of the article, out of the market. They import none but pure and fra-<cb n="2"/>
<lb break="no"/>grant teas, and retail them by the single pound at wholesale prices.
<lb/>Families are always sure of obtaining good teas at this great tea ware-
<lb break="no"/>house, in quantities to suit their convenience, and at the same price
<lb/>that the merchant pays who buys to sell again.—[Daily True Sun.
<lb/>You may be sure of obtaining at all times, pure and highly flavored
<lb/>teas, by the single pound, at wholesale prices, of the Pekin Tea Com-
<lb break="no"/>pany, 75 Fulton street. They have probably the largest stock, and
<lb/>greatest variety of green and black teas, of any one establishment in
<lb/>the United States. They are doing a large business, and a great benefit
<lb/>to consumers of tea.—[Atlas.
<lb/>Heretofore it has been very difficult, indeed impossible, to always
<lb/>obtain good green and black teas; but now you have only to visit the
<lb/>ware-rooms of the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, to obtain as
<lb/>delicious and fragrant teas as you could wish for.—Daily Sun.
<lb/>If any of our readers desire to have good tea, they can obtain it of
<lb/>the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street.—[Mercury.
<lb/>A Word to Tea Drinkers.—The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton
<lb/>street, have imported into this market some five hundred thousand dol-
<lb break="no"/>lars worth of the finest grade of green and black teas, grown in the
<lb/>Celestial Empire, done up in all the various fancy packages that Chi-
<lb break="no"/>nese ingenuity can invent. It is a privilege to buy teas at this great
<lb/>establishment, and a luxury and comfort to drink them. They sell
<lb/>good teas only, and retail them at wholesale prices. Country merchants
<lb/>who wish to always sell good teas can always obtain them at this place,
<lb/>on reasonable terms.—[Emporium.
<lb/>The Pekin Tea Company.—We very cheerfully call the attention
<lb/>of all lovers of pure and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the
<lb/>great tea warehouse of this company. Our long acquaintance with the
<lb/>proprietors enables us to bespeak for them the entire confidence of the
<lb/>public. We know that their teas, both in quality and price, are all that
<lb/>is stated of them. Many a lover of the fragrant herb has been com-
<lb break="no"/>pelled to eschew the drinking of tea in consequence of its injurious
<lb/>effects, until at length he has become hopeless of finding, among any of
<lb/>the imported varieties of tea in our market, a kind which had not such
<lb/>an effect. In this, however, such persons will be agreeably disappointed.
<lb/>The Pekin Tea Company have commenced the importation of choice
<lb/>varieties of Garden Teas, of most delicious flavor—cultivated and
<lb/>picked with great care, which have heretofore never been introduced
<lb/>into this country, except as presents to importers. Among these they
<lb/>have an Oolong, mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we es-
<lb break="no"/>pecially recommend to all nervous persons. Its effect upon many of
<lb/>those who have tried it, is to make them confirmed tea-drinkers. Ladies
<lb/>who have tried it say they never before drank such tea. But all tastes
<lb/>can here be suited, with the great advantage over other stores of getting
<lb/>a pure article at wholesale price, however small the quantity. The
<lb/>company's warehouse is at 75 Fulton street.—[New World.
<lb/>Tea.—The Pekin Tea Company, No. 75Fulton street, unquestionably
<lb/>sell the best teas imported into this market. That they sell them
<lb/>cheaper than any other establishment, is a fact proven in a thousand
<lb/>instances since they have opened their store.
<lb/>We would advise our friends to call at this place, and if they don’t
<lb/>wish to buy, at least to obtain a little pamphlet, kept on their counter,
<lb/>entitled “Hints to Tea-Drinkers,” and therefrom learn a little useful
<lb/>information on the subject. The pamphlet is given gratis.—[Anglo-
<lb break="no"/>American.
<lb/>The finest specimens of green and black teas ever sold in this
<lb/>country, are imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street.
<lb/>Those who want good teas at reasonable prices, can always get them
<lb/>there.—[Tribune.
<lb/>We have tried the teas imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75
<lb/>Fulton street, and, if we live, will try them often. They are selling
