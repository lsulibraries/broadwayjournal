<lg><l>I wish I could be gay, mother,</l>
<l>And happy, for your sake,</l>
<l>On this glad New Year’s day, mother,</l>
<l>But oh, my heart would break</l>
<l>If these tears could not flow, mother:</l>
<l>For to his faithless breast,</l>
<l>This day last year, you know, mother,</l>
<l>I first was fondly prest.</l>
<l>Then first our fond lips met, mother—</l>
<l>’Twas at this very hour—</l>
<l>I feel that kiss even yet, mother,</l>
<l>So strong is memory’s power!</l>
<l>I thought his love was pure, mother,</l>
<l>Nor doubted when he said</l>
<l>’Twould ever thus endure, mother,</l>
<l>Till life itself had fled.</l>
<l>Alas! his love passed o’er, mother—</l>
<l>The love I thought so true—</l>
<l>Whilst I loved more and more, mother,</l>
<l>The colder that he grew!</l>
<l>His love’s forever fled, mother,</l>
<l>My heart is like to break;</l>
<l>I’d wish that I were dead, mother,</l>
<l>Only for your dear sake.</l>
<l>Yet t'would be sweet to die, mother,</l>
<l>For I have prayed to be</l>
<l>An angel, ever nigh, mother,</l>
<l>To guard both him and thee.</l>
<l>But if you’d see me yet, mother,</l>
<l>Happy, and blithe, and gay,</l>
<l>Then teach me to forget, mother,</l>
<l>The last dear New Year’s day.</l>
<l>Yet I’d rather have with tears, mother,</l>
<l>My eyes forever dim,</l>
<l>Than smile through sunny years, mother,</l>
<l>Without fond thoughts of him!</l></lg>

           <head>Loss of Breath.
             <lb/>A TALE NEITHER IN NOR OUT OF “BLACKWOOD.”</head>
              <p>0 breathe not, &amp;c.—Moore’s Melodies.</p>
              <p>The most notorious ill-fortune must, in the end, yield to the
<lb/>untiring courage of philosophy—as the most stubborn city to the<cb n="2"/>
<lb/>ceaseless vigilance of an enemy. Salmanezer, as we have it in
<lb/>the holy writings, lay three years before Samaria; yet it fell.
<lb/>Sardanapalus—see Diodorus—maintained himself seven in Nine-
<lb break="no"/>veh; but to no purpose. Troy expired at the close of the second
<lb/>lustrum; and Azoth, as Aristaeus declares upon his honor as a
<lb/>gentleman, opened at last her gates to Psammitticus, after having
<lb/>barred them for the fifth part of a century.</p>
             <p>*******</p>
             <p>“Thou wretch!—thou vixen!—thou shrew!” said I to my
<lb/>wife on the morning after our wedding, “thou witch!—thou
<lb/>hag!—thou whipper-snapper!—thou sink of iniquity!—thou
<lb/>fiery-faced quintessence of all that is abominable!—thou—thou
<lb/>—” here standing upon tiptoe, seizing her by the throat, and
<lb/>placing my mouth close to her ear, I was preparing to launch
<lb/>forth a new and more decided epithet of opprobrium, which should
<lb/>not fail, if ejaculated, to convince her of her insignificance, when,
<lb/>to my extreme horror and astonishment, I discovered that I had,
<lb/>lost my breath.</p>
            <p>The phrases “I am out of breath,” “I have lost my breath,”
<lb/>&amp;c., are often enough repeated in common conversation; but it
<lb/>had never occurred to me that the terrible accident of which I
<lb/>speak could bona fide and actually happen! Imagine— that is if
<lb/>you have a fanciful turn—imagine, I say, my wonder—my con-
<lb break="no"/>sternation—my despair!</p>
            <p>There is a good genius, however, which has never entirely de-
<lb break="no"/>serted me. In my most ungovernable moods I still retain a sense
<lb/>of propriety, et le chemin des passions me'conduit—as Lord Edouard
<lb/>in the “Julie” says it did him—a la philosophic veritable.</p>
            <p>Although I could not at first precisely ascertain to what degree
<lb/>the occurrence had affected me, I determined at all events to con-
<lb break="no"/>ceal the matter from my wife, until farther experience should dis-
<lb break="no"/>cover to me the extent of this my unheard of calamity. Altering
<lb/>my countenance, therefore, in a moment, from its bepuffed and
<lb/>distorted appearance, to an expression of arch and coquettish
<lb/>benignity, I gave my lady a pat on the one cheek, and a kiss on
<lb/>the other, and without saying one syllable, (Furies! I could not,)
<lb/>left her astonished at my drollery, as I pirouetted out of the room
<lb/>in a Pas de Zephyr.</p>
            <p>Behold me then safely ensconced in my private boudoir, a fear-
<lb break="no"/>ful instance of the ill consequences attending upon irascibility—
<lb/>alive with the qualifications of the dead—dead with the propensi-
<lb break="no"/>ties of the living—an anomaly on the face of the earth—being
<lb/>very calm, yet breathless.</p>
            <p>Yes! breathless. I am serious in asserting that my breath was
<lb/>entirely gone. I could not have stirred with it a feather if my
<lb/>life had been at issue, or suilied even the delicacy of a mirror
<lb/>Hard fate!—yet there was some alleviation to the first overwhelm-
<lb break="no"/>ing paroxysm of my sorrow. I found, upon trad, that the
<lb/>powers of utterance which, upon my inability to proceed in the
<lb/>conversation with my wife, I then concluded to be totally de-
<lb break="no"/>stroyed, were in fact only partially impeded, and I discovered
<lb/>that had I at that interesting crisis, dropped my voice to a sin-
<lb break="no"/>gularly deep guttural, I might still have continued to her the
<lb/>communication of my sentiments; this pitch of voice (the guttural)
<lb/>depening I find, not upon the current of the breath, but upon a
<lb/> certain spasmodic action of the muscles of the throat.</p><pb n="398"/><cb n="1"/>
           <p>Throwing myself upon a chair, I remained for some time ab-
<lb break="no"/>sorbed in meditation. My reflections, be sure, were of no consol-
<lb break="no"/>atory kind. A thousand vague and lachrymatory fancies took
<lb/>possession of my soul—and even the idea of suicide flitted across
<lb/>my brain; but it is a trait in the perversity of human nature to
<lb/>reject the obvious and the ready, for the far-distant and equivocal.
<lb/>Thus I shuddered at self-murder as the most decided of atrocities
<lb/>while the tabby cat purred strenously upon the rug, and the very
<lb/>water-dog wheezed assiduously under the table; each taking to
<lb/>itself much merit for the strength of its lungs, and all obviously-
<lb break="no"/>done in derision of my own pulmonary incapacity.</p>
            <p>Oppressed with a tumult of vague hopes and fears, I at length
<lb/>heard the footsteps of my wife descending the staircase. Being
<lb/>now assured of her absence, I returned with a palpitating heart
<lb/>to the scene of my disaster.</p>
            <p>Carefully locking the door on the inside, I commenced a vigor-
<lb break="no"/>ous search. It was possible, I thought that, concealed in some ob-
<lb break="no"/>scure corner, or lurking in some closet or drawer, might be found
<lb/>the lost object of my inquiry. It might have a vapory—it might
<lb/>even have a tangible form. Most philosophers, upon many
<lb/>points of philosophy, are still very unphilosophical. William
<lb/>Godwin, however, says in his “Mandeville,” that “invisible
<lb/>things are the only realities,” and this all will allow, is a case in
<lb/>point. I would have the judicious reader pause before accusing j
<lb/>such asseverations of an undue quantum of absurdity. Anaxago-
<lb break="no"/>ras, it will be remembered, maintained that snow is black, and this
<lb/>I have since found to be the case.</p>
            <p>Long and earnestly did I continue the investigation: but the
<lb/>contemptible reward of my industry and perseverance proved to
<lb/>be only a set of false teeth, two pair of hips, an eye, and a bun-
<lb break="no"/>dle of billetts-doux from Mr. Windenough to my wife. I might
<lb/>as well here observe that this confirmation of my lady’s partiality
<lb/>for Mr. W. occasioned me little uneasiness. That Mrs. Lacko-
<lb break="no"/>breath should admire any thing so dissimilar to myself was a
<lb/>natural and necessary evil. I am, it is well known, of a robust
<lb/>and corpulent appearance, and at the same time somewhat dimin-
<lb break="no"/>utive in stature. What wonder then that the lath-like tenuity of
<lb/>my acquaintance, and his altitude which has grown into a prov-
<lb break="no"/>erb, should have met with all due estimation in the eyes of Mrs.
<lb/>Lackobreath. But to return.</p>
            <p>My exertions, as I have before said, proved fruitless. Closet
<lb/>after closet—drawer after drawer—corner after corner—were
<lb/>scrutinized to no purpose. At one time, however, I thought
<lb/>myself sure of ray prize, having, in rummaging a dressing case,
<lb/>accidentally demolished a bottle of Grandjean’s Oil of Archangels
<lb/>—which, as an agreeable perfume, I here take the liberty of re-
<lb break="no"/>commending.</p>
            <p>With a heavy heart I returned to my boudoir—there to ponder
<lb/>upon some method of eluding my wife’s penetration, until I could
<lb/>make arrangements prior to my leaving the country, for to this I
<lb/>had already made up my mind. In a foreign climate, being un-
<lb break="no"/>known, I might, with some probability of success, endeavor to
<lb/>conceal my unhappy calamity—a calamity calculated, even more
<lb/>than beggary, to estrange the affections of the multitude, and to
<lb/>draw down upon the wretch the well-merited indignation of the
<lb/>virtuous and the happy. I was not long in hesitation. Being
<lb/>naturally quick, I committed to memory the entire tragedy of
<lb/>"Metamora.” I had the good fortune to recollect that in the ac-
<lb break="no"/>centuation of this drama, or at least of such portion of it as is
<lb/>allotted to the hero, the tones of voice in which I found myself
<lb/>deficient were altogether unnecessary, and that the deep guttural
<lb/>was expected to reign monotonously throughout.</p>
            <p>I practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented
<lb/>marsh;—herein, however, having no reference to a similar pro-<cb n="2"/>
<lb/>ceeding of Demosthenes, but from a design peculiarly and con-
<lb break="no"/>scientiously my own. Thus armed at all points, I determined to
<lb/>make my wife believe that I was suddenly smitten with a pas-
<lb break="no"/>sion for the stage. In this, I succeeded to a miracle; and to every
<lb/>| question or suggestion found myself at liberty to reply in my most
<lb/> frog-like and sepulchral tones with some passage from the tra-
<lb break="no"/>gedy—any portion of which, as I soon took great pleasure in ob-
<lb break="no"/>serving, would apply equally well to any particular subject. It
<lb/>is not to be supposed, however, that in the delivery of such pas-
<lb break="no"/>sages I was found at all deficient in the looking asquint—the
<lb/>showing my teeth—the working my knees—the shuffling my
<lb/>feet—or in any of those unmentionable graces which are now
<lb/>justly considered the characteristics of a popular performer. To
<lb/>be sure they spoke of confining me in a straight-jacket—but,
<lb/>good God! they never suspected me of having lost my breath.</p>
            <p>Having at length put my affairs in order, I took my seat very
<lb/>early one morning in the mail stage for——, giving it to be un-
<lb break="no"/>derstood, among my acquaintances, that business of the last im-
<lb break="no"/>portance required my immediate personal attendance in that city.</p>
            <p>The coach was crammed to repletion; but in the uncertain
<lb/>twilight the features of my companions could not be distinguished.
<lb/>Without making any effectual resistance, I suffered myself to be
<lb/>placed between two gentlemen of colossal dimensions; while a
<lb/>third, of a size larger, requesting pardon for the liberty he was
<lb/>about to take, threw himself upon my body at full length, and
<lb/>falling asleep in an instant, drowned all my guttural ejaculations
<lb/>for relief, in a snore which would have put to blush the roarings
<lb/>of the bull of Phalaris. Happily the state of my respiratory fac-
<lb break="no"/>ulties rendered suffocation an accident entirely out of the question.</p>
            <p>As, however, the day broke more distinctly in our approach
<lb/>to the outskirts of the city, my tormentor arising and adjusting
<lb/>his shirt-collar, thanked me in a very friendly manner for my
<lb/>civility. Seeing that I remained motionless, (all my limbs were
<lb/>dislocated and my head twisted on one side,) his apprehensions
<lb/>began to be excited; and arousing the rest of the passengers, he
<lb/>communicated in a very decided manner, his opinion that a dead
<lb/>man had been palmed upon them during the night for a living
<lb/>and responsible fellow-traveler; here giving me a thump on the
<lb/>right eye, by way of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion.</p>
            <p>Hereupon all, one after another, (there were nine in company,)
<lb/>believed it their duty to pull me by the ear. A young practising
<lb/>physician, too, having applied a pocket-mirror to my mouth, and
<lb/>found me without breath, the assertion of my prosecutor was
<lb/>pronounced a true bill; and the whole party expressed a deter-
<lb break="no"/>mination to endure tamely no such impositions for the future,
<lb/>and to proceed no farther with any such carcasses for the present.</p>
            <p>I was here, accordingly thrown out at the sign of the “Crow,”
<lb/>(by which tavern the coach happened to be passing) without
<lb/>meeting with any farther accident than the breaking of both my
<lb/>arms under the left hind wheel of the vehicle. I must besides do
<lb/>the driver the justice to state that he did not forget to throw after
<lb/>me the largest of my trunks, which, unfortunately falling on my
<lb/>head, fractured my skull in a manner at once interesting and ex-
<lb break="no"/>traordinary.</p>
            <p>The landlord of the “Crow,” who is a hospitable man, finding
<lb/>that my trunk contained sufficient to idemnify him for any little
<lb/>trouble he might take in my behalf, sent forthwith for a surgeon
<lb/>of his acquaintance, and delivered me to his care with a bill and
<lb/>receipt for ten dollars.</p>
            <p>The purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced ope-
<lb break="no"/>rations immediately. Having cut off my ears, however, he dis-
<lb break="no"/>covered signs of animation. He now rang the bell, and sent for
<lb/>a neighboring apothecary with whom to consult in the emer-
<lb break="no"/>gency. In case of his suspicions with regard to my existence<pb n="399"/><cb n="1"/>
<lb/>proving ultimately correct, he, in the meantime, made an incision
<lb/>in my stomach, and removed several of my viscera for private
<lb/>dissection.</p>
            <p>The apothecary had an idea that I was actually dead. This
<lb/>idea I endeavored to confute, kicking and plunging with all my
<lb/>might, and making the most furious contortions—for the opera-
<lb break="no"/>tions of the surgeon had, in a measure, restored me to the pos-
<lb break="no"/>session of my faculties. All, however, was attributed to the
<lb/>effects of a new galvanic battery, wherewith the apothecary, who
<lb/>is really a man of information, performed several curious experi-
<lb break="no"/>ments, in which, from my personal share in their fulfilment, I
<lb/>could not help feeling deeply interested. It was a source of morti-
<lb break="no"/>fication to me nevertheless, that although I made several attempts
<lb/>at conversation, my powers of speech were so entirely in abeyance,
<lb/>that I could not even open my mouth; much less then make
<lb/>reply to some ingenious but fanciful theories of which, under
<lb/>other circumstances, my minute acquaintance with the Hippocra-
<lb break="no"/>tian pathology would have afforded me a ready confutation.</p>
            <p>Not being able to arrive at a conclusion, the practitioners
<lb/>remanded me for farther examination. I was taken up into a
<lb/>garret; and the surgeon’s lady having accommodated me with
<lb/>drawers and stockings, the surgeon himself fastened my hands,
<lb/>and tied up my jaws with a pocket handkerchief—then bolted the
<lb/>door on the outside as he hurried to his dinner, leaving me alone
<lb/>to silence and to meditation.</p>
            <p>I now discovered to my extreme delight that I could have
<lb/>spoken had not my mouth been tied up by the pocket-handker-
<lb break="no"/>chief. Consoling myself with this reflection, I was mentally
<lb/>repeating some passages of the “Omnipresence of the Deity,” as
<lb/>is my custom before resigning myself to sleep, when two cats, of
<lb/>a greedy and vituperative turn, entering at a hole in the wall,
<lb/>leaped up with a flourish á la Catalani, and alighting opposite
<lb/>one another on my visage, betook themselves to indecorous con-
<lb break="no"/>tention for the paltry consideration of my nose.</p>
            <p>But, as the loss of his ears proved the means of elevating to
<lb/>the throne of Cyrus, the Magian or Mige-Gush of Persia, and as
<lb/>the cutting off his nose gave Zopyrus possession of Babylon, so
<lb/>the loss of a few ounces of my countenance proved the salvation
<lb/>of my body. Aroused by the pain, and burning with indignation,
<lb/>I burst, at a single effort, the fastenings and the bandage.—
<lb/>Stalking across the room I cast a glance of contempt at the belli-
<lb break="no"/>gerents, and throwing open the sash to their extreme horror and
<lb/>disappointment, precipitated myself, very dexterously, from the
<lb/>window.</p>
            <p>The mail-robber W——, to whom I bore a singular resem-
<lb break="no"/>blance, was at this moment passing from the city jail to the
<lb/>scaffold erected for his execution in the suburbs. His extreme
<lb/>infirmity, and long-continued ill health, had obtained him the
<lb/>privilege of remaining unmanacled; and habited in his gallows
<lb/>costume—one very similar to my own—he lay at full length in
<lb/>the bottom of the hangman’s cart (which happened to be under
<lb/>the windows of the surgeon at the moment of my precipitation)
<lb/>without any other guard than the driver who was asleep, and
<lb/>two recruits of the sixth infantry, who were drunk.</p>
            <p>As ill-luck would have it, I alit upon my feet within the vehi-
<lb break="no"/>cle. W———, who was an acute fellow, perceived his oppor-
<lb/>tunity. Leaping up immediately, he bolted out behind, and
<lb/>turning down an alley, was out of sight in the twinkling of an
<lb/>eye. The recruits, aroused by the bustle, could not exactly
<lb/>comprehend the merits of the transaction. Seeing, however, a
<lb/>man, the precise counterpart of the felon, standing upright in thә
<lb/>cart before their eyes, they were of opinion that the rascal
<lb/>(meaning W——) was after making his escape, (so they
<lb/>expressed themselves,) and, having communicated this opinion<cb n="2"/> 
<lb/>to one another, they took each a dram, and then knocked me
<lb/>down with the butt-ends of their muskets.</p>
            <p>It was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination. Of
<lb/>course nothing could be said in my defence. Hanging was my
<lb/>inevitable fate. I resigned myself thereto with a feeling half
<lb/>stupid, half acrimonious. Being little of a cynic, I had all the
<lb/>sentiments of a dog. The hangman, however, adjusted the noose
<lb/>about my neck. The drop fell.</p>
            <p>I forbear to depict my sensations upon the gallows; although
<lb/>here, undoubtedly, I could speak to the point, and it is a topic
<lb/>upon which nothing has been well said. In fact, to write upon
<lb/>such a theme it is necessary to have been hanged. Every
<lb/>author should confine himself to matters of experience. Thus
<lb/>Mark Anthony composed a treatise upon getting drunk.</p>
            <p>I may just mention, however, that die I did not. My body
<lb/>was, but I had no breath to be, suspended; and but for the knot
<lb/>under my left ear (which had the feel of a military stock) I
<lb/>dare say that I should have experienced very little inconvenience.
<lb/>As for the jerk given to my neck upon the falling of the drop, it
<lb/>merely proved a corrective to the twist afforded me by the fat
<lb/>gentleman in the coach.</p>
            <p>For good reasons, however, I did my best to give the crowd
<lb/>the worth of their trouble. My convulsions were said to be
<lb/>extraordinary. My spasms it would have been difficult to beat.
<lb/>The populace encored. Several gentlemen swooned; and a mul-
<lb break="no"/>titude of ladies were carried home in hysterics. Pinxit availed
<lb/>himself of the opportunity to retouch, from a sketch taken upon
<lb/>the spot, his admirable painting of the “Marsyas flayed alive.”</p>
            <p>When I had afforded sufficient amusement, it was thought
<lb/>proper to remove my body from the gallows;—this the more
<lb/>especially as the real culprit had in the meantime been re-
<lb break="no"/>taken and recognized; a fact which I was so unlucky as not to
<lb/>know.</p>
            <p>Much sympathy was, of course, exercised in my behalf, and
<lb/>as no one made claim to my corpse, it was ordered that I should
<lb/>be interred in a public vault.</p>
            <p>Here, after due interval, I was deposited. The-sexton departed,
<lb/>and I was left alone. A line of Marston’s “Malcontent”—
                   <lg><l>Death’s a good fellow and keeps open house —</l>
                       <l>struck me at that moment as a palpable lie.</l></lg></p>
            <p>I knocked off, however, the lid of my coffin, and stepped out.
<lb/>The place was dreadfully dreary and damp, and I became troubled
<lb/>with ennui. By way of amusement, I felt my way among the
<lb/>numerous coffins ranged in order around. I lifted them down,
<lb/>one by one, and breaking open their lids, busied myself in specu-
<lb break="no"/>lations about the mortality within.</p>
            <p>“This,” I soliloquized, tumbling over a carcass, puffy, bloated,
<lb/>and rotund—” this has been, no doubt, in every sense of the
<lb/>word, an unhappy—an unfortunate man. It has been his terri-
<lb break="no"/>ble lot not to walk, but to waddle—to pass through life not like
<lb/>a human being, but like an elephant—not like a man, but like a
<lb/>rhinoceros.</p>
            <p>“His attempts at getting on have been mere abortions, and
<lb/>his circumgyratory proceedings a palpable failure. Taking a
<lb/>step forward, it has been his misfortune to take two toward the
<lb/>right, and three toward the left. His studies have been confined
<lb/>to the poetry of Crabbe. He can have had no idea of the won-
<lb break="no"/>ders of a pirouette. To him a pas de papillon has been an ab-
<lb break="no"/>stract conception. He has never ascended the summit of a hill.
<lb/>He has never viewed from any steeple the glories of a metropolis.
<lb/>Heat has been his mortal enemy. In the dog-days his days have
<lb/>been the days of a dog. Therein, he has dreamed of flames and
<lb/>suffocation—of mountains upon mountains—of Pelion upon Ossa,
<lb/>He was short of breath—to say all in a word, he was short of<pb n="400"/><cb n="1"/>
<lb/>breath. He thought it extravagant to play upon wind instru-
<lb break="no"/>ments. He was the inventor of self-moving fans, wind-sails,
<lb/>and ventilators. He patronized Du Pont the bellows-maker, and
<lb/>died miserably in attempting to smoke a cigar. His was a case
<lb/>in which I feel deep interest—a lot in which I sincerely sympa-
<lb break="no"/>thize.”</p>
            <p>“But here,” said I—“here”—and I dragged spitefully from
<lb/>its receptacle a guant, tall, and peculiar-looking form, whose re-
<lb break="no"/>markable appearance struck me with a sense of unwelcome
<lb/>familiarity—“here is a wretch entitled to no earthly commisera-
<lb break="no"/>tion.” Thus saying, in order to obtain a more distinct view of
<lb/>my subject, I applied my thumb and fore-finger to its nose, and,
<lb/>causing it to assume a sitting position upon the ground, held it
<lb/>thus, at the length of my arm, while I continued my soliloquy.</p>
            <p>—“Entitled,” I repeated, "to no earthly commiseration. Who
<lb/>indeed would think of compassionating a shadow? Besides, has
<lb/>he not had his full share of the blessings of mortality? He was
<lb/>the originator of tall monuments—shot-towers—lightning-rods—
<lb/>lombardy-poplars. His treatise upon “Shades and Shadows”
<lb/>has immortalized him. He edited with distinguished ability the
<lb/>last edition of “South, on the Bones.” He went early to college
<lb/>and studied pneumatics. He then came home, talked eternally,
<lb/>and played upon the French-horn. He patronized the bag-pipes.
<lb/>Captain Barclay, who walked against Time, would not walk
<lb/>against him. Windham and Allbreath were his favorite writers.
<lb/>—his favorite artist, Phiz. He died gloriously while inhaling

            <p>“How can you?—how—can—you?”—interrupted the object
<lb/>of my animadversions, gasping for breath, and tearing off, with a
<lb/>desperate exertion, the bandage around its jaws—“how can you,
<lb/>Mr. Lackobreath, be so infernally cruel as to pinch me in that
<lb/>manner by the nose? Did you nut see how they had fastened
<lb/>up my mouth—and you must know—if you know anything—
<lb/>how vast a superfluity of breath I have to dispose of! If you
<lb/>do not know, however, sit down and you shall see.— In my sit-
<lb break="no"/>uation it is really a great relief to be able to open one’s mouth—
<lb/>to be able to expatiate—to be able to communicate with a person
<lb/>like yourself, who do not think yourself called upon at every
<lb/>period to interrupt the thread of a gentleman’s discourse.—Inter-
<lb break="no"/>ruptions are annoying and should undoubtedly be abolished—
<lb/>don’t you think so?—no reply, I beg you,—one person is enough
<lb/>to be speaking at a time.—I shall be done by-and-by, and then
<lb/>you may begin.—How the devil, sir, did you get into this place?
<lb/>—not a word I beseech you—been here some time myself—ter-
<lb break="no"/>rible accident!—heard of it, I suppose—awful calamity!—walk-
<lb break="no"/>ing under your windows—some short while ago—about the time
<lb/>you were stage-struck—horrible occurrence!—heard of “catch-
<lb break="no"/>ing one’s breath,” eh?—hold your tongue I tell you!—I caught
<lb/>somebody else’s!—had always too much of my own—met Blab
<lb/>at the corner of the street—would’nt give me a chance for a word
<lb/>—could’nt get in a syllable edgeways—attacked, consequently,
<lb/>with epilepsis—Blab made his escape—damn all fools!—they
<lb/>took me up for dead, and put me in this place—pretty doings all
<lb/>of them!—heard all you said about me—every word a lie—hor-
<lb break="no"/>rible!—wonderful!—outrageous!—hideous!—incomprehensible!
<lb/>—et cetera—et cetera—et cetera—et cetera”—</p>
            <p>It is impossible to conceive my astonishment at so unexpected
<lb/>a discourse; or the joy with which I became gradually convinced
<lb/>that the breath so fortunately caught by the gentleman (whom I<cb n="2"/>
<lb/>soon recognized as my neighbor Windenough) was, in fact, the
<lb/>identical expiration mislaid by myself in the conversation with
<lb/>my wife. Time, place, and circumstance rendered it a matter
<lb/>beyond question. I did not, however, immediately release my
<lb/>hold upon Mr. W.’s proboscis—not at least during the long pe-
<lb break="no"/>riod in which the inventor of lombardy-poplars continued to
<lb/>favor me with his explanations.</p>
            <p>In this respect I was actuated by that habitual prudence which
<lb/>has ever been my predominating trait. I reflected that many
<lb/>difficulties might still lie in the path of my preservation which
<lb/>only extreme exertion on my part would be able to surmount.
<lb/>Many persons, I considered, are prone to estimate commodities
<lb/>in their possession—however valueless to the then proprietor—
<lb/>however troublesome, or distressing—in direct ratio with the ad-
<lb break="no"/>vantages to be derived by others from their attainment, or by
<lb/>themselves from their abandonment. Might not this be the case
<lb/>with Mr. Windenough? In displaying anxiety for the breath of
<lb/>which he was at present so willing to get rid, might I not lay
<lb/>myself open to the exactions of his avarice? There are scoun-
<lb break="no"/>drels in this world, I remembered with a sigh, who will not scru-
<lb break="no"/>ple to take unfair opportunities with even a next door neighbor,
<lb/>and (this remark is from Epictetus) it is precisely at that time
<lb/>when men are most anxious to throw off' the burden of their own
<lb/>calamities that they feel the least desirous of relieving them in
<lb/>others.</p>
            <p>Upon considerations similar to these, and still retaining my
<lb/>grasp upon the nose of Mr. W., I accordingly thought proper to
<lb/>model my reply.</p>
            <p>“Monster!” I began in a tone of the deepest indignation,
<lb/>“monster! and double-winded idiot!—dost them whom, for thine
<lb/>iniquities, it has pleased heaven to accurse with a two-fold res-
<lb break="no"/>piration—dost thou, I say, presume to address me in the familiar
<lb/>language of an old acquaintance?—“I lie,” forsooth! and “hold
<lb/>my tongue,” to be sure!—pretty conversation, indeed, to a gen-
<lb break="no"/>tleman with a single breath!—all this, too, when I have it in my
<lb/>power to relieve the calamity under which thou dost so justly
<lb/>suffer—to curtail the superfluities of thine unhappy respiration.”</p>
            <p>Like Brutus, I paused for a reply—with which, like a tornado,
<lb/>Mr. Windenough immediately overwhelmed me. Protestation
<lb/>followed upon protestation, and apology upon apology. There
<lb/>were no terms with which he was unwilling to comply, and
<lb/>there were none of which I failed to take the fullest advantage.</p>
            <p>Preliminaries being at length arranged, my acquaintance de-
<lb break="no"/>livered me the respiration; for which (having carefully examined
<lb/>it) I gave him afterwards a receipt.</p>
            <p>I am aware that by many I shall be held to blame for speak-
<lb break="no"/>ing, in a manner so cursory, of a transaction so impalpable. It
<lb/>will be thought that I should have entered more minutely into
<lb/>the details of an occurrence by which—and this is very true—
<lb/>much new light might be thrown upon a highly interesting branch
<lb/>of physical philosophy.</p>
            <p>To all this I am sorry that I cannot reply. A hint is the only
<lb/>answer which I am permitted to make. There were circum-
<lb break="no"/>stances—but I think it much safer upon consideration to say as
<lb/>little as possible about an affair so delicate—so delicate, I repeat,
<lb/>and at the same time involving the interests of a third party
<lb/>whose sulphurous resentment I have not the least desire, at this
<lb/>moment, of incurring.</p>
            <p>We were not long after this necessary arrangement in effecting
<lb/>an escape from the dungeons of the sepulchre. The united
<lb/>strength of our resuscitated voices was soon sufficiently appa-
<lb break="no"/>rent. Scissors, the Whig Editor, republished a treatise upon
<lb/>“the nature and origin of subterranean noises.” A reply—
<lb/>rejoinder—confutation—and justification—followed in the col-<pb n="401" break="no" /><cb n="1"/>
<lb break="no"/>umns of a Democratic Gazette. It was not until the opening of
<lb/>the vault to decide the controversy, that the appearance of Mr.
<lb/>Windenough and myself proved both parties to have been deci-
<lb break="no"/>dedly in the wrong.</p>
            <p> I cannot conclude these details of some very singular passages
<lb/>in a life at all times sufficiently eventful, without again recalling
<lb/>to the attention of the reader the merits of that indiscriminate
<lb/>philosophy which is a sure and ready shield against those shafts
<lb/>of calamity which can neither be seen, felt, nor fully understood.
<lb/>It was in the spirit of this wisdom that, among the Ancient
<lb/>Hebrews, it was believed the gates of Heaven would be inevita-
<lb break="no"/>bly opened to that sinner, or saint, who, with good lungs and
<lb/>implicit confidence, should vociferate the word "Amen” It
<lb/>was in the spirit of this wisdom that, when a great plague raged
<lb/>at Athens, and every means had been in vain attempted for its
<lb/>removal, Epimenides, as Laertius relates in his second book of
<lb/>that philosopher, advised the erection of a shrine and temple
<lb/>"to the proper God.”</p>	<byline><persName>Littleton Barry</persName>.</byline></div>

           <head>A College Reminiscence. </head>
            <p>During the month of July, in the year 183-, there were
<lb/>some remarkably pleasant afternoons. I am not sure that this is
<lb/>the most approved mode of opening a story, (?) but I speak of
<lb/>the quality of the weather, because I think it well to start fairly
<lb/>in this respect before giving affairs a local habitation and a name.
<lb/>And I now prefix to the said “ afternoons,” “ in the renowned
<lb/>city of Dorp, N. Y.” Good. There are three Colleges in Dorp;
<lb/>but they compose but one institution. Tria juncta in uno. One
<lb/>of these buildings is in the heart of the city, and the other two
<lb/>are situate on the brow of a gentle acclivity some quarter of a
<lb/>mile eastward, standing distant from each other a few rods, and
<lb/>each being perhaps a hundred and fifty feet in length. In a
<lb/>lower room, in one of these last named ones, on one of those
<lb/>pleasant afternoons (the term fast drawing to its close) we sat,
<lb/>chum Ben and myself, ostensibly intent upon our lessons, but in
<lb/>fact sedulously laboring to maintain our eyes in a state of visi-
<lb break="no"/>bility. The day was rather sultry, the sky and air hazy, and
<lb/>nature seemed to have sunken into a repose as profound as that
<lb/>of midnight. Not a sound was to be heard; and from our win-
<lb break="no"/>dow we might have looked abroad over green fields, and wave-
<lb break="no"/>less waters, and motionless groves, and sleepy houses, in the
<lb/>dim distance, all composing a scene such as any glorious old
<lb/>painter would have delighted to feast upon. It was a day to
<lb/>rock asleep every faculty, mental and bodily. I was dozing in an
<lb/>arm-chair by the window, and fast becoming insensible—when I
<lb/>experienced a singular, though not unpleasant sensation, like
<lb/>that of a swift translation to a vast distance. I opened my eyes,
<lb/>and found myself by some mysterious means, in a great and mag-
<lb break="no"/>nificently furnished apartment, surrounded by a host of officers
<lb/>and retainers, all attired in a manner splendid beyond description,
<lb/>all exhibiting signs of the most violent agitation, and all bending
<lb/>their appalling looks upon myself alone.</p>
            <p>Despite the abruptness of the transition, and the novelty of my
<lb/>situation, I could not help inly marveling at the facility of the
<lb/>change, as well as at the purpose of those by whom I was thus
<lb/>circumvented—when suddenly burst upon my ear a crash, as of
<lb/>a falling citadel, and one wild, prolonged, tremendous shout, like
<lb/>that of ten thousand thousand men, rushing to some sanguinary
<lb/>and merciless encounter. The whole vast edifice in an instan
<lb/>appeared to tremble like an aspen, and then all again was still as
<lb/>death. I gazed at those around me; and now their countenances
<lb/>were strangely calm and rigid. I gazed—and gazed—and still I
<lb/>saw the same fixed, unchanging, withering, glare of the myr-
<lb break="no"/>midons. No word—no sound disturbed the sickening silence.
<lb/>Each bore an unsheathed sword, and seemed as if only anxiously
<lb/>awaiting some signal at which to hew me into a thousand pieces.
<lb/>My wonder began to turn to mortal fear. I was entirely un-
<lb break="no"/>armed; though, had I had a hundred stout soldiers at my back,<pb n="402"/><cb n="1"/>
<lb/>knew that resistance would be utterly fruitless. I made attempt
<lb/>after attempt to speak, and each time my voice stuck in my
<lb/>throat. I shook, I tottered, and was falling—when burst another
<lb/>thunder sound, far louder than the first, and followed by a single,
<lb/>soul-piercing scream, that ran through me like fire. My terrible
<lb/>confronters raised a deafening shout, and rushed with one accord
<lb/>from the room. But one remained; and he, apparently their
<lb/>chief, advancing a few steps nearer me, cried, “Traitor, thy
<lb/>doom is well nigh sealed. Thy foul conspiracy hath ripened,
<lb/>hath broken forth, and will perchance subvert the throne. But
<lb/>thou, thou at least, art a worthy precursor of thy master to the
<lb/>grave!”</p>
            <p>As I saw no manifestation on his part of an intention to be the
<lb/>immediate fulfiller of his announcement, I essayed, (and this time
<lb/>I accomplished it) to ask a solution of his words, and of the ter-
<lb break="no"/>rible sights and sounds I had witnessed and heard. He deigned
<lb/>no direct answer; but from his passionate and incoherent ejacu-
<lb break="no"/>lations I was able to gather, that a most sudden and awful revolt
<lb/>had broken out against the mightiest monarch of earth; that his
<lb/>palace (in which I was) had been assailed, his guards butch-
<lb break="no"/>ered, an entrance effected by the insurgents within the outer
<lb/>walls, that the king was in his highest and innermost chamber,
<lb/>barred and bolted—vain obstacle to the murderous onslaught of
<lb/>such a murderous horde as was fast approaching!—and that I, I
<lb/>was the proven machinator and maturer of the horrid plot. I
<lb/>was terror-stricken, but perfectly aware of the uselessness of any
<lb/>endeavor at explanation. All other thoughts and considerations
<lb/>were merged in those of an inexpressibly intense fear and desire
<lb/>of instant escape from my present torture.</p>
            <p>Strange! but in the very depths of my despair, I resorted to
<lb/>successful trickery. I gave a nervous leap, uttered a loud cry,
<lb/>and, with the energy of one who hunted almost to the death, and
<lb/>on the verge of utter hopelessness, sees a glimmer of possible
<lb/>escape, I pointing to a spot directly behind my adversary, su.
<lb/>ceeded in momentarily averting his face. I had observed a door
<lb/>partially open, three or four feet to my left, and through it I now
<lb/>flew with the rapidity of an arrow, closing it behind me. As it shut,
<lb/>I distinctly heard a spring on the side where I stood, fasten it.
<lb/>Thank God, I was safe from my more imminent tormentor. How
<lb/>my heart quivered with the conviction!</p>
            <p>I was in a long, dark, narrow passage, at the further extremity
<lb/>of which gleamed a streak of faint, white light. As my way was
<lb/>straight, I consumed little time in traversing the intermediate
<lb/>space, and soon found myself in a small apartment, the walls of
<lb/>which were cutup by apertures of all sizes, some of which admitted
<lb/>light. I took the one opposite where I entered, and hurrying on
<lb/>a short distance further, came to another and much more spacious
<lb/>room; and so light that, coming into it suddenly, my eyes were
<lb/>for a moment completely dazzled. I paused an instant to recover,
<lb/>and then observed that I was at the bottom of a broad flight of
<lb/>stairs, covered with the most brilliant carpeting. Involuntarily
<lb/>elevating my sight, I looked up—and up—and far up those stairs,
<lb/>which were of an almost incredible length, and sparkling all the
<lb/>way with the same rich covering; and there, at the very edge of
<lb/>the summit, in broad day, every feature distinctly visible, with
<lb/>terrible mien, and his right hand upraised on high and grasping
<lb/>a glittering battle-axe,—there, his gorgeous purple robes glowing
<lb/>in the flood of light that burst upon and around him—there silent,
<lb/>solitary, and like some surpassingly glorious minister of retribu-
<lb break="no"/>tive justice—there towered that mighty monarch! I felt his
<lb/>burning eye-glance; I almost heard the beating of his heart. I
<lb/>perceived his recognition of me as his destroyer, and would have
<lb/>bartered worlds, had they been at my disposal, for the ability to
<lb/>stand beside him, and ease my bosom of the horrid load that was<cb n="2"/>
<lb/>crushing it. And I could not stir a finger! I tried to cry out—
<lb/>to make a sign with my hand—but I was spell-bound and power-
<lb break="no"/>less. With painful exertion I withdrew my gaze, and once more
<lb/>looked about, to discover some avenue for flight; but in vain!
<lb/>There was no aperture except that through which I had come.
<lb/>I thought it better to starve and die in that gloomy passage, than
<lb/>remain where I was; and was preparing again to seek it, when I
<lb/>heard a far-off jarring noise, succeeded by the sound of footsteps
<lb/>rapidly approaching. It flashed across me that my fearful enemy
<lb/>had forced the door I had closed against him, and was coming
<lb/>upon me where I could offer no show of resistance. I again
<lb/>looked up—and again met the same dread monarch-terror, now
<lb/>poising his upheaved axe in attitude to hurl it—the shadow of a
<lb/>frown flitting athwart his noble countenance, and his eyes glisten-
<lb break="no"/>ing with an expression of unmingled malignity. His form trem-
<lb break="no"/>bled, his nostrils dilated, his lips parted; and, throwing further
<lb/>back his right arm with the might of a giant, he launched at me
<lb/>the awful missile! I saw him swing it once—twice—and oh!
<lb/>how intolerably bright it gleamed!—thrice—and it was on its
<lb/>descent.</p>
            <p>Immediately before this, I had been in agony indescribable.
<lb/>My memory was incoherent, almost to frenzy. Sometimes I
<lb/>thought it might all be some dreamy illusion that would shortly
<lb/>pass away. Then the emotions that swept across me with hor-
<lb break="no"/>rid rapidity, chased away the thought, as the tornado whirls the
<lb/>feather. Then, again, if I could remove but a very—very little, I
<lb/>would be temporarily safe. And then came, nearer and more
<lb/>near, distinctly, and more distinctly echoing, those fearful foot-
<lb break="no"/>falls. All this of course transpired in a few seconds, intermediate
<lb/>the first and last demonstrations of his fell intention; and there
<lb/>it came, that axe—I saw its stream of glancing light—and on the
<lb/>instant heard a short, shrill whistle, and then a cleaving crash
<lb/>behind me. He had missed me!</p>
            <p>Ha! I felt the presence of one I had so lately eluded. He was
<lb/>upon me, and I durst not turn to meet him.</p>
            <p>There—there once more pealed a last, terrible roar, like the
<lb/>giant bellowings of a thousand thunders! It died away. And
<lb/>he who now stood by my side, shouted—shouted out a laugh like
<lb/>the laugh of a hell-fiend. The monarch-terror caught it up.
<lb/>He laughed—and it sounded in my ears like the trumpet of doom.
<lb/>It was caught up by hundreds, by thousands, by myriads, whom
<lb/>I could not see, and who were, I could not guess where. My
<lb/>anguish overpowered me, and I sank prostrate.</p>
            <p>The concussion was severe. I awoke without delay, and as-
<lb break="no"/>certained distinctly that I had made a descent upon the floor. Of
<lb/>course I next arose; and on further examination learned that I
<lb/>had undergone all these shocking vicissitudes in less than a half-
<lb break="no"/>jhour. Next I naturally went to the window to take a view of
<lb/> things external—and the first objects that attracted my atten-
<lb break="no"/>tion, were, a few feet directly below me, on the stone-
<lb break="no"/> pavement running the whole length of the College, (unusual
<lb/> sight!) the mangled remains of two particularly aged cane bot-
<lb break="no"/>tomed chairs, beautifully locked together in death; a huge mass
<lb/> of tightly bound papers, an old table, (of yore covered with green
<lb/>baize), two legs and part of the top of an antique bureau, and
<lb/>some few other such like specimens of architecture; all which
<lb/>had been gratuitously dismissed from further service by some
<lb/>beneficent individuals in the fourth story. This curious compi-
<lb break="no"/>lation had evidently been just made, and ten to one not yet re-
<lb break="no"/>ceived its last accession. The noise unavoidably incident to its
<lb/>formation, was the noise with which I had so recently been
<lb/>stunned. The shouts, and the dread demoniacal laughter, had
<lb/>been the hurrahs and cachinations of my friends above, as this
<lb/>work progressed. I aroused my sleeping chum, and having<pb n="403"/><cb n="1"/>
<lb/>pointed out the condition of matters, began discussing the phi-
<lb break="no"/>losophy of dreams. Telling him in few words, the most promi-
<lb break="no"/>nent incidents of my own, and its seeming length, I was about to
<lb/>hazard the opinion that I had not slept over five minutes—when
<lb/>down came a supplemental chair to swell the aforesaid pile.</p>
            <p>Now the monotony of the afternoon had been broken by some
<lb/>few fellows above, with little previous ceremony, and less regard
<lb/>for the sleepers below; and as the wherefore was at present
<lb/>altogether inscrutable, and as a person in such a state of half
<lb/>lethargy and indifference to anything that fails to appeal to the
<lb/>auditories, is far more easily incensed than at other times, we
<lb/>unanimously voted the whole affair a bore, and that an immediate
<lb/>investigation be instituted. But crack came down again, rather
<lb/>more obstreperously than their predecessors, another and a huge
<lb/>table, and an antique hat. Again, slam bang—and there lay
<lb/>ejected from another upper room, the skeleton of an unlucky
<lb/>bedstead. Probably the first fall had been the result of accident;
<lb/>but the affair had now assumed a very different aspect. Anon
<lb/>descended a feather bed, cheered on by reiterated shouts. All
<lb/>of the upper strata were aroused: and every one feeling it impera-
<lb break="no"/>tive upon him to contribute his mite, cast out some piece of fur-
<lb break="no"/>niture or another. It became a perfect storm of nondescripts—
<lb/>papers, tables, chairs, benches, beds, bedsteads, book-cases,
<lb/>hooks, bowls, pitchers, etc., and finally, as a close-up, from some
<lb/>of the loftiest rooms, down came, with a crash upon the stones
<lb/>just beside the heap, a massive Nott stove, shattered into fifty
<lb/>pieces. It was amusing to observe the varied compound—and
<lb/>still more so to see a flaming brand descend right into the midst,
<lb/>and ignite it with a suddenness and facility that was surprising.
<lb/>A finer victim for the fire can scarcely be conceived. I shall never
<lb/>forget the curious scene. I suppose there was scarcely an indi-
<lb break="no"/>vidual in all the front rooms, who had failed to help form the
<lb/>structure—and all without the most remote idea of its ultimate
<lb/>destination, and at the sacrifice too, of some articles that at any
<lb/>other time could not have been well spared, it had been done in
<lb/>an amazingly short time. No matter. Away blazed the fire, up
<lb/>rolled the smoke in dense volumes; and the students now looked;
<lb/>on in mute and grim satisfaction at the catastrophe of the drama.</p>
            <p>Rattle, rattle, rattle, came the College engine, and puff, puff,
<lb/>puff, came our major-domo, old Pat, and the mighty few unfortu-
<lb break="no"/>nates whom he had pressed into the service, from afar, having 
<lb/>presumed the occurrence of something quite horrible. Down
<lb/>they bore, with a zeal most decidedly worthy a better cause;
<lb/>till, turning a short angle, they came plumply upon the scene,
<lb/>tugging and straining and blowing and hurraing in glorious
<lb/>style. For a moment they seemed stupefied with a sense of the
<lb/>ridiculous figure they were cutting; and I verily think they
<lb/>would, had not some master-blow been struck, have unanimously
<lb/>flung up their high trust, and vacated the premises. But Pat,
<lb/>really no mean statesman in affairs of this sort, and kicking at
<lb/>the prospective imputation of having been so taken in and done
<lb/>for, took up the office of director-general with his most majestic
<lb/>air. Calmly elevating his eyes, and looking envenomed daggers
<lb/>at those grinning upon him from every window, he remarked,
<lb/>loudly enough to be distinctly audible some indefinite distance
<lb/>beyond the College, “that he was quite well advised, before
<lb/>starting, of the nature of the fire; that he had come to save the
<lb/>building from the destruction that certainly threatened it,” &amp;c.;
<lb/>and concluded with a vigorous exhortation for them to remit
<lb/>their mirth, and aid in extinguishing the flames.</p>
            <p>The reply was as ready as it was unequivocal; consisting of
<lb/>divers streams of water, boots, shoes, tobacco-pipes, and a pro-
<lb break="no"/>fuse aspersion of opprobrious epithets “too numerous to men-
<lb break="no"/>tion.” However, as none of these materially harmed him, and<cb n="2"/>
<lb/>as he saw that all hope of assistance was futile, he completed
<lb/> his engineering arrangements, and with his cohort began lustily
<lb/> playing away, much about the time when all that was con-
<lb break="no"/>sumable had been consumed. Still he played away among the
<lb/>embers, and finally succeeded in kicking up a cloud of steam and
<lb/>ashes, and giving the last faint spark its everlasting quietus.
<lb/>Which consummation attained, with a sudden twist of the pipe,
<lb/>he bestowed upon ten or a dozen of the most uproarious lookers-
<lb break="no"/>on, a sprinkling gratis, nervously observing “there.”</p>
            <p>Some two or three Professors had by this time arrived; and,
<lb/>in conformity to their suggestions, (the genial offspring of a few
<lb/>moments’ grave and confidential conference,) Pat and his adjuncts
<lb/>made a retrogressive movement—considerably more silent than
<lb/>their onset. And soon after, the drenched fragments were
<lb/>removed, the engine right carefully replaced, and the Professors
<lb/>leisurely returned to their studies and the Students to their books,
<lb/>and all was as tranquil as at the moment before the tumult.</p>
            <p>The next recitations were remarked to be rather severe; and
<lb/>the Tutors, laboring under an unusually onerous sense of their
<lb/>responsibility, seized every convenient occasion to manifest their
<lb/>partiality for well-recited lessons, and their reprobation of the
<lb/>reverse. Still, like most other sublunary afflictions, this proved
<lb/>to be but temporary. And as the “young gentlemen” made for
<lb/>a season somewhat closer application than common, soon all things
<lb/>went on as ever before, and the affair was forgotten.</p>
            <p>*****</p>        
            <p>And those days are gone—are passed away, forever and for-
<lb break="no"/>ever. And other footsteps cross those thresholds—other voices
<lb/>sound within those walls—other tenants be there of those well-
<lb break="no"/>remembered rooms. And between those who were wont to meet
<lb/>in one small recitation room, day after day, month after month,
<lb/>year after year—between them now, broad-cast over God’s great
<lb/>earth, do mountains rise, and oceans roll, and silent deserts
<lb/>spread. And of the old Professors, some are gone; and their
<lb/>places are filled by strangers—no doubt as kind, no doubt as
<lb/>competent, but yet not the same! Much, very much is changed.
<lb/>Still, could the class of 183- be once again convened in the old
<lb/>chapel as of yore, every member in his same old seat, how would
<lb/>their hearts heave with a multitude of undefinable feelings, and
<lb/>the tear start at the up-gushing tide of holiest memories!</p>

                <p>Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell. By Thomas Carlyle.
<lb/>In 2 vols. New York: Wiley &amp; Putnam.</p>
                <p>A most valuable work this is—from the intrinsic merit of the
<lb/>letters and speeches it contains, and not from the rhapsodical,
<lb/>really run-mad comments of Carlyle. Yet, even with this addi-
<lb break="no"/>tion, the work is a desirable one. No published memoirs, that
<lb/>we have yet seen, so clearly exhibit the man Cromwell, the
<lb/>hold, iron-willed ruler, as these transcripts of his inner soul.
<lb/>Now, that attention is called to the man and his times, by the
<lb/>discussion concerning the propriety or impropriety of placing his
<lb/>statue in the new Parliament House of England, his letters and
<lb/>speeches become of a double interest.</p>
              <p>The character and purposes of Cromwell seem to have been as
<lb/>singularly misunderstood as those of the third Richard. Crom-
<lb break="no"/>well was an ambitious, bold and unscrupulous man, who
<lb/>changed through circumstances. At first he was a republican,
<lb/>and bent his whole energies and his giant intellect—giant even
<lb/>among the intellectual Anakims of that day—to achieve a model<cb n="2"/>
<lb/>commonwealth. But, once obtaining power, he naturally grew
<lb/>to be a tyrant. He was, for all that, a good king, so far as the
<lb/>external interests of the country were concerned; and his politic
<lb/>administration of public affairs contrasts favorably with that of
<lb/>any king who preceded or followed him on the English throne.
<lb/>We call him “king,” for, lord protector only in name, he was
<lb/>monarch in fact.</p>
              <p>We always esteemed Cromwell the more for the manner in
<lb/>which he routed that scum of hypocritical rascals, the Rump
<lb/>Parliament. It is a pity for his memory that a man like Carlyle
<lb/>should have engaged in the edition of his letters and speeches,
<lb/>and we recommend readers to note only the text of the book be-
<lb break="no"/>fore us, and let the comments alone.</p>
              <p>The volume is very neatly got up, as all of the series—Library
<lb/>of Choice Reading—of which it forms a part, are.</p></div>

              <p>The Pilgrim in the Shadow of the Jungfrau. By Geo. B. Chee-

              <p>Dr. Cheever dedicates his book to Richard H. Dana, whom he
<lb/>calls, in the dedication, “the poet of ‘Daybreak’”—why, we
<lb/>cannot for our life conceive. The book itself is Cheeverish—if
<lb/>we may coin a phrase—in the extreme. It has a great deal of de-
<lb break="no"/>scriptive merit, is full of blunders of composition, and abuses the
<lb/>Catholics right roundly. The quotations made, and frequently
<lb/>introduced, show considerable taste.</p></div>

              <p>“The Aristidean for November.”</p>
              <p>“The Aristidean for December,” by Thomas Dunn English and
<lb/>numerous collaborators.</p>
              <p>These two numbers have been lying on our table for some
<lb/>time, and we have not been able to give them a proper notice.
<lb/>The November number contains some especially bold and racy
<lb/>articles—among the rest, a stirring tale called “Ferrando the
<lb/>Avenger.” The poetry is not so good as usual, which is a pity,
<lb/>as the “Aristidean” has hitherto held an unquestionable pre-<pb n="405" break="no" /><cb n="1"/>
<lb/>eminence in that way. There is a queer paper, “The Dearborn
<lb/>Poems,” which contains some piquant satire. The article on
<lb/>“ American Poetry,” is very biting, but, unfortunately, very true.
<lb/>There is a very able and dignified article “On the Penalty of
<lb/>Death.” The book notices are spirited and independent, and the
<lb/>remaining articles are above the mass of magazine papers, in
<lb/>quality. One of these we extract below; we believe it to be
<lb/>from the pen of Herrman S. Saroni. It is, unquestionably, very
<lb/>original, in conception and execution.</p>
              <p>THE SELF-PERFORMERS.</p>
              <p>“Bravo! bravissimo!” cried the audience, as they left the
<lb/>concert-room of the Conservatoire at Milan. A symphony, by
<lb/>a new master, had just been performed. The public had ex-
<lb break="no"/>pected nothing; and so much were they surprised at the beauty
<lb/>of the new composition, that after an hour of intense silence,
<lb/>they could vent nothing but ejaculations of delight. The young
<lb/>master, himself, yet sat pondering over the score of his favorite
<lb/>creation. He had, at length, accomplished his long-cherished
<lb/>object. A composition of his own had been performed, with
<lb/>distinguished success, before a critical and intelligent audience.
<lb/>Intoxicated with success, and yet dizzy from the thunders of
<lb/>applause, he read the score over and over again, with intense
<lb/>admiration. His eye beamed with pleasure, and all his troubles
<lb/>seemed forgotten. He blessed the old schoolmaster who had
<lb/>beaten counterpoint into him. With deep pleasure he brought
<lb/>to mind the petty strife with his little Mary, who, when he was
<lb/>tired of the study of music, always urged him to renewed exer-
<lb break="no"/>tion. “Oh! Mary,” thought he, “were you only here to
<lb/>witness the triumph of your Carlo.” He was interrupted in his
<lb/>musing by a strain of his symphony, which he thought he heard
<lb/>in the distance. “I must be mistaken,” said he, “it is the air
<lb/>through a half-opened window, sighing against the instruments
<lb/>around me. Hark! another strain. It is the adagio of the first
<lb/>part, coming nearer and nearer. I can now hear the different
<lb/>instruments distinctly.”</p>
              <p>It was indeed an attempt to perform the adagio of the sym-
<lb break="no"/>phony. A rustling was heard in the orchestra. The musicians
<lb/>had left their instruments behind; and the forgotten things chose
<lb/>to have a little performance on their own hook. While the horns
<lb/>and trumpets were getting out of their chests, the flute was con-
<lb break="no"/>versing with the oboe and clarionet, the fagotti gave his opinion
<lb/>of the merit of the composition—trying a snatch of it now and
<lb/>then—and even the piccolo, spoke up at the highest pitch of his
<lb/>voice. Next, the contrabasso, first in a gentle murmur, then in
<lb/>a serious grumble, and at last, in quite angry thunder, reproached
<lb/>them with mutilating the work of his favorite composer. Sup-
<lb break="no"/>ported by the violins, violoncellos and violas, he at last gained
<lb/>the desired point over the assembled wind-instruments; and they
<lb/>ail agreed to perform the symphony over again, under the direc-
<lb break="no"/>tion of the venerable double-bass, himself. They yielded, on
<lb/>the condition that one of the first-violins should assist in the
<lb/>direction. The instruments were tuned, the double-bass placed
<lb/>himself at the leader’s stand, and a first-violin part served as a
<lb/>partition. The baton was raised, and with a tremendous crash,
<lb/>the orchestra fell in.</p>
              <p>The flutes, clarionet and fagotti, first played a passage in in-
<lb break="no"/>verted chords and double-harmonies. “Double-bass!” cried the
<lb/>leader, after a few minutes—A, D, E, F; but no double-bass was
<lb/>to be found.</p>
              <p>“Ha, ha, ha!” chuckled the oboe, “does the fool think that
<lb/>some one else will play his part? As for me, I shall not, for
<lb/>one; but perhaps the piccolo will be kind enough to do the job.”
<lb/>But the piccolo was too high in pitch, the bassoon had plenty of
<lb/>solos himself, the violoncello was too weak, the corni could not
<lb/>play the chromatic scale, and the trombone was altogether too
<lb/>loud. A general confusion ensued, and the whole affair had like
<lb/>to have been broken up, when a tap by the leader brought all to
<lb/>order again.</p>
              <p>“Gentlemen,” said he to the orchestra, “I forgot, when I
<lb/>undertook to lead, that l could not play at the same time. But 
<lb/>it will never do to give it up so,’ and we must find means to
<lb/>perform this symphony in a manner worthy of ourselves.”</p>
              <p>“Bravo! bravo!” was the reply of the orchestra.</p>
              <p>“If that stupid old fool had sense enough to take a part, all
<lb/>would go well yet,” said the bassoon, pointing to a venerable,
<lb/>worn-out double-bass, who rested on the laurels he had won in
<lb/>former years.</p><cb n="2"/>
              <p>The composer, trembling all the while for the fate of his dar-
<lb break="no"/>ling symphony, no sooner perceived the old double-bass in the
<lb/>corner, than seizing the first bow he could find, he grasped the
<lb/>“stupid old fool,” by the neck, and took a stand near the vio-
<lb break="no"/>loncello.</p>
              <p>“Bravo! bravo!” screamed the orchestra. The leader turned
<lb/>round, nodded his approbation, and rapping with his baton on
<lb/>the tin, called out—“Symphony da capo!”</p>
              <p>The introduction and first allegro were now performed. All
<lb/>went on well, except that the oboe and the flute quarreled on a
<lb/>fortissimo passage, because the flute found the oboe rather too
<lb/>noisy and harsh.</p>
              <p>“Bravissimo, young man,” said the double-bass to the young
<lb/>maestro. “It is a pity you had not stronger nerves; what a
<lb/>capital double-bass you would make.”</p>
              <p>“How beautifully he has written this passage for me,-’ said
<lb/>the clarionet.</p>
              <p>“He writes for me almost as well as I could for myself,” said
<lb/>the saucy piccolo.</p>
              <p>The instruments were tuned again, and at a signal from the
<lb/>leader they resumed their proper position. The violins leaned
<lb/>against the music-stands, the trombone hung itself on a chande-
<lb break="no"/>lier, the violoncello rested on a small bench, and the others chose
<lb/>such positions as best suited their inclinations. The andante
<lb/>began with two corni, followed in succession by the fagotto, oboe
<lb/>and flute. The oboe came in one bar too soon, but a gentle
<lb/>thump from the fagotto reminded her of her whereabouts, and set
<lb/>all right again. The theme began by the corni, was carried
<lb/>through by the different instruments, and ended with a crescendo
<lb/>de crescendo on the drums. No ! no! there are the stringed-in-
<lb break="no"/>struments, with three chords pizzicato. Another pleasant nod
<lb/>from the leader was the reward of the composer, from whom the
<lb/>perspiration now ran in a stream.</p>
              <p>“Hurrah for the scherzo” cried the trumpets; “plenty of
<lb/>work there for us.”</p>
              <p>“Hurrah for the scherzo P’ responded the violins, “our fingers
<lb/>will have no time to freeze, there.”</p>
              <p>“ Hurrah for the scherzo blasted the trombone.</p>
              <p>“Hurrah!” groaned the double-bass from the leader’s stand.</p>
              <p>The scherzo began. All went on peaceably for a short time
<lb/>until the flute, thinking the piccolo was out of time, gave the
<lb/>latter a kick, which sent him half-a-dozen yards from the stand.
<lb/>But the piccolo took his part with him, and getting a stand near
<lb/>the violins, screamed away to his heart’s delight. His new
<lb/>neighbors, unaccustomed to such a noise in their vicinity, got
<lb/>angry; and a pinch in the sides from one of them, completely
<lb/>overturned the piccolo’s ideas of high and low. The unfortunate
<lb/>wight ran from one place to another, in despair, though never
<lb/>omitting to take his part with him, and play, whenever he thought
<lb/>it his turn. At length he popped into one of the holes of the
<lb/>double-bass, and thus protected from the persecutions of his com-
<lb break="no"/>rades, reflected on his singular in the belly of a double-bass, like
<lb/>that of Jonah in the inside of the whale. But if he thought
<lb/>himself safe here from persecution, he was mistaken; for not a
<lb/>minute had elapsed, when in peeps the head of the oboe, and the
<lb/>body soon followed.</p>
              <p>“All safe here, brother piccolo?” inquired the new-comer.</p>
              <p>“All right, sister oboe,” answered the other; “but how, in the
<lb/>devil’s name, did you come here?”</p>
              <p>“In the same manner as I shall send you out, presently, if you
<lb/>do not behave yourself.”</p>
              <p>“Well, I had a great mind to laugh, when I saw you squeez-
<lb break="no"/>ing yourself through that hole there, an aperture almost too
<lb/>narrow for my slender figure; but a passage I had to play, in
<lb/>octaves, with the flute, just then prevented me.”</p>
              <p>“And very well for you,” said the oboe, “or you would not
<lb/>have enjoyed this place, snug enough for even decent people, like
<lb/>myself. Now, sir, look to your part, and disturb me no more.”</p>
              <p>They both played on for some time, when the oboe had sixty
<lb/>bars rest. “Come, brother,” affectionately said the oboe, “let
<lb/>me tell you what sent me to keep company with a screamer like
<lb/>you, in this accursed place, where the most sentimental passages
<lb/>sound like the voices of demons from the infernal regions.”</p>
              <p>“I cannot say that of myself,” replied the piccolo. “I think
<lb/>they know out there where my domicile is.”</p>
              <p>“Ah!” exclaimed the oboe, “there is my turn again. Not for
<lb/>the world could I miss a single note of that symphony, for I mean
<lb/>to make that young fellow, its author, write a concerto for me.”</p>
              <p>The next rest for the oboe gave her a chance to continue her
<lb/>narration, for the piccolo was then as busy as a bee. It appeared<pb n="406"/><cb n="1"/>
<lb/>that the trombone, who, as we have stated, had hung himself on
<lb/>a chandelier, thought he heard a wrong note. He listened atten-
<lb break="no"/>tively, but could discover nothing, until the oboe, playing a pas-
<lb break="no"/>sage out of time, he could distinguish her voice easily; and such
<lb/>playing was more than he could bear. His blood boiled with
<lb/>rage; but he reserved his revenge for a more favorable opportu-
<lb break="no"/>nity. Presently a fortissimo passage gave him a fine chance, and
<lb/>with a tremendous blast, he sent the oboe—poor thing! heels
<lb/>over head, against the violoncello. The blast was so powerful,
<lb/>that she rebounded; but, most unfortunately, leaped right into
<lb/>the funnel of the horn. This, of course, threw a damper on the
<lb/>spirits of that instrument, and lowered it a semi-tone in pitch.
<lb/>Enraged at what it deemed to be a malicious trick, the horn
<lb/>played with double force, until the oboe was driven out, and
<lb/>sent, by a strong blast, right into the arms of the drum, and such
<lb/>a flogging as it received there, one cannot imagine. A fortissimo
<lb/>tremolo gave a good chance to the drum to take revenge for those
<lb/>tricks, played him by the oboe, on many occasions. Breathless
<lb/>and exhausted, our poor sufferer at last found a shelter inside of
<lb/>the double-bass.</p>
              <p>The violins, violoncello and double-bass, had no time to carry
<lb/>on a quarrel. Besides, they found it far beneath their dignity to
<lb/>mingle with the common crowd, since it was their duty to main-
<lb break="no"/>tain the reputation of the orchestra. But the flutes, clarionets,
<lb/>second oboe, corni, trombones and trumpets had a jolly time of
<lb/>it. The trombone tried to drown the voices of all the others;
<lb/>hut, at the first chance, they combined against him, and nothing
<lb/>was heard of the trombone. At one time, he grew very angry,
<lb/>for he thought that the drum had spoiled the effect of a beautiful
<lb/>passage where he could blast ad libitum. So he took a long
<lb/>draught, on playing the double e’s, and tried to hit the sticks of
<lb/>the drum; but the latter was prepared for him, and, with one
<lb/>stick, took the other and hurled it at the trombone. The latter,
<lb/>bewildered with fright, threw the stick at the leader on the
<lb/>stand, and just then the scherzo ended. And none need suppose
<lb/>the scherzo to have been a failure; for this quarreling took place
<lb/>in the proper place, as the composer wrote forte, fortissimo, piano
<lb/>or pianissimo in the score, and all the fighting was done in the
<lb/>rests that occurred.</p>
              <p>The scherzo being over, the oboe peeped out of one hole,
<lb/>and the piccolo out of the other; and encouraged by the benig-
<lb break="no"/>nant smiles of the stringed-instruments, ventured to return to
<lb/>their old places. The first bassoon taking them under his special
<lb/>protection, they were easily reconciled to the trombone and the
<lb/>rest. The leader returned the stick to the drum, the first violin
<lb/>put on a new E string, and in a few minutes all were ready to
<lb/>continue. Prestissimo was the appendix to the last part of the
<lb/>symphony; but the leader thought that presto, under existing
<lb/>circumstances, was as much as they were capable to do. The
<lb/>baton again sounded on the tin; and away they all went, tearing
<lb/>everything with them, in their eagerness to do justice to the
<lb/>spirit of the composition. The corni were the first, who—after
<lb/>playing a beautiful passage in 6-8 time, gave in—the trombones
<lb/>soon followed—and the trumpets, after a brilliant fanfare, with
<lb/>drum accompaniment, bade good-bye to the rest, and returned to
<lb/>their respective chests. The piccolo played on until entirely out
<lb/>of breath, and then fell, like a lump of lead, on the ground.
<lb/>Flutes, clarionets, oboes and bassoons bore up bravely; hut they
<lb/>could not resist the supernatural power which hurried them on to
<lb/>the yawning abyss—the end of the symphony. One more shriek,
<lb/>and they were silent as the grave. The stringed-instruments
<lb/>al one were now masters of the field. Encouraged by an occa-
<lb break="no"/>sional bravo from the leader, they fiddled and fiddled until a
<lb/>tremolo fortissimo set them raving mad, and an arpeggio chord
<lb/>put an end to their dominion. The leader laid down his baton,
<lb/>and fell in the arms of the young composer; and the latter, with
<lb/>the score in one hand, a bow in the other, and a double-bass on
<lb/>each side of him, was found the next morning by his alarmed
<lb/>friends.</p>

              <p>One of the most wonderful pieces of mechanism ever produced
<lb/>through mental conception is now exhibiting at Philadelphia, and
<lb/>will be shortly to be shown in this city. We allude to the speak-
<lb break="no"/>ing automaton of Herr Faber—an invention, after seventeen years
<lb/>of labor, almost perfected by the ingenious inventor. It is not
<lb/>a machine to labor through easy words of two syllables, indis-
<lb break="no"/>tinctly made out at that. It enunciates distinctly, at the will of
<lb/>the performer, any words or combinations of words; and can
<lb/>even sing, in perfect imitation of a man. It has excited the at-
<lb break="no"/>tention of scientific men at Philadelphia; and their investigation
<lb/>has led them to implicit belief in its merits as a work of art.<pb n="408"/><cb n="1"/>
<lb/>Professor Patterson and Dr. Goddard, savans of note in our sister
<lb/>city, introduced it, a few evenings since, to the public—the latter
<lb/>accompanying the introduction with a brief lecture on acoustics</p>
              <p>It is managed, externally, somewhat likә a piano. There are
<lb/>fourteen keys, each having a simple sound; and from these and
<lb/>their combinations all the other sounds proceed. Mr. Faber has
<lb/>determined that five vowel and nine consonant sounds are suf-
<lb break="no"/>ficient for the correct enunciation of any words in the English
<lb/>language. The consonants are b, d,f, g l, r, s, v and w, and the
<lb/>consonants a, e, i, o and u. There are two extra keys—one for
<lb/>the aspirate, the other for the nasal sounds. The mechanism is
<lb/>so perfect that the lips of the figure move and its nostrils expand
<lb/>naturally, as it speaks. The performer sits at his apparent piano,
<lb/>and plays out the conversation of the automaton. The voice has,
<lb/>however, a rather dry, sepulchral sound; but, as Professor Pat-
<lb break="no"/>terson remarked, “India rubber is not flesh”—not a very original
<lb/>idea, to be sure, but explanatory enough.</p>
              <p>Mr. Faber exhibited this machine—not so perfect then as now
<lb/>—in this city and in Philadelphia, three years since. Unknown
<lb/>as he was, and having no scientific men to stand as sponsors to
<lb/>him, the invention was pronounced to be a deceit, although re-
<lb break="no"/>flection would have convinced all those with power to reflect that
<lb/>deception was out of the question. So discouraged was Faber
<lb/>by his ill-fortune, that he burned his machine in utter despair.
<lb/>We believe he was even on the point of committing suicide, when
<lb/>Mr. Scherr, a kind-hearted piano manufacturer of Philadelphia,
<lb/>struck with the merit of the invention, rendered him assistance,
<lb/>and encouraged him in every way to reconstruct a more perfect
<lb/>automaton. The result is before the public; and we venture to
<lb/>say, that the people of New York will flock in delighted num-
<lb break="no"/>bers—when the opportunity is afforded them—to view this cu-
<lb break="no"/>rious triumph of human ingenuity.</p>
              <p>There remains only one achievement—a machine to think.<cb n="2"/>
<lb/>We should say, perhaps, there has remained; for certain books
<lb/>lately printed induce us to believe that some people think by a
<lb/>machine. By that, if it exist, and this wonderful reproduction
<lb/>of Roger Bacon’s brazen head, stump speakers and advocates can
<lb/>be provided at short notice for our political gatherings and our
<lb/>court ofs justice.</p></div>

              <p>N. C. Brooks, A. M., of Baltimore, well known as a terse and

<lb/>DOCT. H. E. SCHOONMAKER, Dental Surgeon, Office, 44G
<lb/>Houston st., two doors from Broadway—opposite St. Thomas’
<lb/>Church.
<lb/>Doct. S.’s experience and skill in his profession give him confi-
<lb break="no"/>dence in asserting that his operations are unsurpassed by any Den-
<lb break="no"/>tist in this city. Dr. S.’s manner of inserting artificial teeth varies
<lb/>in many essential points from the usual mode; and his success in
<lb/>pleasing all, he is happy to say, has brought him many difficult
<lb/>cases, which had been unsuccessfully treated by Dentists of estab-
<lb break="no"/>lished professional reputation, and whose prices for the same opera-
<lb break="no"/>tion were double his own. The object in inserting artificial teeth
<lb/>is to supply the deficiency occasioned by the loss of natural teeth,
<lb/>both in regard to utility, comfort in wearing, and natural appear-
<lb break="no"/>ance. In all these points, Dr. S.’s manner is pre-eminent. His
<lb/>mechanical tact and ingenuity have enabled him to surmount many
<lb/>obstacles, which have long, with the profession generally, impeded
<lb/>the path to success in every operation. He makes use of the best
<lb/>materials in all his operations—and in cases where the gum has
<lb/>fallen away by absorption, (which is always the case, more or less,
<lb/>when teeth have been extracted,) which causes a contraction of the
<lb/>lips and cheeks, the disfigurement of which cannot be fully obviated
<lb/>without adopting the artificial gums, which will supply the de-
<lb break="no"/>ficiency, and give to the mouth its usual redundancy—besides, their
<lb/>beauty and natural appearance render detection impossible.
<lb/>Dr. S. would be happy to refer those who require it, to many of
<lb/>the best families in this City, in which he has practised.

<lb break="no"/>dences, by sending their address as above.	nov8—9t</ab></div>

<lb/>RECENTLY PUBLISHED BY
<lb/>HARPER &amp; BROTHERS, NEW YORK.
<lb/>I.
<lb/>THE AMERICAN SHEPHERD.
<lb/>1 vol. 12mo. With Illustrations. Price 75 cents, paper; bound
<lb/>in cloth gilt, $1,00.
<lb/>We regard this as the most valuable and important work for
<lb/>farmers that has appeared for a long time. We have examined it
<lb/>closely, and we do not hesitate to say it is just what is wanted by
<lb/>the sheep farmers of this country. Previous to its publication, the
<lb/>manuscript was submitted to the inspection of the Executive Com-
<lb break="no"/>mittee of the N. Y. State Agricultural Society, and received the
<lb/>following commendation from that body; “The committee have great
<lb/>pleasure in recommending the work to the attention of wool-grow-
<lb break="no"/>ers, and others interested in the breeding and management of sheep,
<lb/>as one containing a large amount of practical and scientific informa-
<lb break="no"/>tion on this most important branch of American agriculture.” The
<lb/>work contains a complete history and description of all the known
<lb/>varieties and breeds of sheep, illustrated with portraits of the prin-
<lb break="no"/>cipal kinds, with remarks on their comparative value for different
<lb/>purposes, their management in different countries and climates,
<lb/>their diseases, &amp;c. An appendix is added, embracing upward of
<lb/>twenty letters from eminent wool-growers and sheep-fatteners in
<lb/>different states, detailing their respective modes of management.—
<lb/>Ohio Cultivator.
<lb/>This book is one of startling value. It was written by a practical
<lb/>man, who, for many years, has devoted himself to the rearing of
<lb/>sheep, with great ardor. He writes, in the practical portions of the
<lb/>work, what his own eyes have seen, and what his own hands have
<lb/>handled. It is written in a straight-forward, plain style; it is ar-
<lb break="no"/>ranged with sufficient clearness, and gives valuable information on
<lb/>the subjects of which it treats. Whether a farmer keeps ten or ten
<lb/>thousand sheep, he ought to possess it.—Baptist Recorder.
<lb/>This is the best work for the American farmer which has yet ap-
<lb break="no"/>peared on the subject of sheep-husbandry, and we believe it is the
<lb/>only elaborate treatise which has been written with peculiar refe-
<lb break="no"/>rence to the methods required in the management of sheep in this
<lb/>country.—N.Y. Commercial Advertiser.
<lb/>II.
<lb/>ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF DOMESTIC ECONOMY.
<lb/>1 large vol. 8vo. 1000 Illustrations. Sheep Extra.—Price
<lb/>$3,75.
<lb/>The practical utility of this work commends it very strongly to
<lb/>public favor. It treats of various matters connected with do-
<lb break="no"/>mestic economy, in such a plain and comprehensive manner, that
<lb/>few can look over its pages, without finding something to interest
<lb/>them—something which will promote their comfort, and oftentimes
<lb/>prove of pecuniary advantage. In point of general utility this is,
<lb/>perhaps, the best work issued for some time.—Courier and En-
<lb break="no"/>quirer.
<lb/>This is decidedly a book for the million ; it contains all that pre-
<lb break="no"/>cise kind of information adapted to the use of families, and which
<lb/>one may seek a long time for, in vain, elsewhere.—Evening Ga-
<lb break="no"/>zette.
<lb/>This is one of those works which cannot fail to be of real utility
<lb/>to all classes who will take the trouble to turn to its pages for in-
<lb break="no"/>formation.—Evening Post.
<lb/>No one possessing the means to purchase, and capable of appre-
<lb break="no"/>ciating this Encyclopaedia, will fail to procure it It will render
<lb/>most important services in every family in which it is introduced.—
<lb/>Evangelist.
<lb/>Those who are desirous of acquainting themselves with the
<lb/>way and manner of doing everything to promote the comfort of their
<lb/>families and friends, with the least possible trouble and expense,
<lb/>will find this work a valuable acquisition.—Seneca Courier.
<lb/>III
<lb/>TREATISE ON DOMESTIC ECONOMY.
<lb/>Improved Edition. X vol. 12mo. Plates. Price 75 cents.
<lb/>This is emphatically a useful book. It contains a vast amount of
<lb/>intelligence concerning mental and physical health, together with a
<lb/>great deal of information concerning the regulation of the house-
<lb break="no"/>hold and the judicious disposition of time and means.—Sunday

<lb/>This volume is so well known, and so thoroughly appreciated,
<lb/>that we need only call attention to the issue of an improved edition.
<lb/>It is very generally adopted as a text-book in female schools. It has
<lb/>been examined by the Massachusetts Board of Education, and by
<lb/>them deemed worthy of admission as a part of the Massachusetts
<lb/>School Library—an honor which speaks for itself.—Evening Post.
<lb/>If this work could be read, and studied ,and applied by all the young
<lb/>ladies of the land, it would certainly be the means of bringing about
<lb/>a new era, both in civilization and enjoyment. It touches every<cb n="2"/>
<lb/>point in domestic economy in which a young female can be supposed
<lb/>to be interested, and it brings out many points which are seen at
<lb/>once to be of great moment, but which would have escaped any
<lb/>other than the scrutinizing eye of a female philanthropist. We
<lb/>would recommend to every mother to provide her daughters with a
<lb/>copy of this work, and to enjoin it upon them as a sacred duty to
<lb/>read and ponder, and follow its excellent directions.—Evangelist.

<div><ab>THE SECOND VOLUME OF
THE ARISTIDEAN:
<lb/>A JOURNAL OF REVIEWS, POLITICS, AND LIGHT LIT-
<lb break="no"/>ERATURE—By Thomas Dunn English, and numerous col-
<lb break="no"/>laborators—commences on the 20th of January, 1846.
<lb/>The Aristidean is published monthly, each number containing
<lb/>80 pages, octavo, printed on handsome white paper, with bold, clear
<lb/>type, at Five Dollars per annum, payable in advance.
<lb/>The aim of the editor has been to establish a Journal of Art and
<lb/>Letters, whose papers should be distinguished for force, vigor, sar-
<lb break="no"/>casm and pith, rather than an unutterable and bathetic profundity;
<lb/>one, which should not fear to expose literary quackery, and give to
<lb/>writers a proper precedence; one that had the moral courage to
<lb/>praise an enemy’s good works, and censure a friend’s bad ones; one
<lb/>that would maintain a rigorous independence on literary, political
<lb/>and religious matters; one that would attack all abuses without
<lb/>scruple; one that was insensible to fear, and deaf to favor; and one
<lb/>that depended for success on the merit of its papers, and not on the
<lb/>names announced as contributors. If the editor may judge from the
<lb/>high panegyric of the press, and the more substantial evidence of an
<lb/>increasing subscription list, he has succeeded in his intention.
<lb/>Those desiring to sustain an independent and fearless magazine
<lb/>will be kind enough to remit their subscriptions by mail, rather
<lb/>than through an agent.

<lb/>“ This is a beautiful volume, splendidly bound, and still more

<lb/>“This work is one of the most profound and philosophical ever
<lb/>writen upon the character and institutions of our country.—Boston
<lb/>Traveler.
<lb/>“As a study of political science, this book stands unrivaled in

<lb/>which it has been conceived and completed.”—London Times.

<lb/>1 vol. 12mo.—$1.
<lb/>“Few characters have stood out more boldly on our Revolutionary
<lb/>Annals, or have supplied more interesting and exciting materials
<lb/>for the historian than that of Gen. Marion; and it is not saying too
<lb/>much to claim for the work before us no less the merit of accredited
<lb/>historical truth, than the most stirring and absorbing attributes of
<lb/>high-wrought fiction.”—Democratic Review.
<lb/>VIII.
<lb/>THE POETICAL WORKS OF PRAED.
<lb/>Lillian, and other Poems, Fanciful and Facetious. By William
<lb/>Mackworth Praed. First collected edition. Edited by R. W.
<lb/>Griswold, 1 vol. 12mo., muslin,. $1 25.
<lb/>“Praed was the Poet of Society, ‘ a fellow of infinite humor,’ and
<lb/>in scholarship and art, surpassed by none of the English poets of
<lb/>the age. Though many of his pieces have been almost universally
<lb/>read in this country, they have never yet been printed collectively
<lb/>either here or in England.”—Democratic Review.</ab></div>

<lb/>* Caution.—Large quantities of Hyson Skin are retailed in this
<lb/>market as being a Hyson Tea. It is well worth while to compare
<lb/>the Hyson Tea usually sold at 75 cents with the genuine article
<lb/>that the company offer at the same price. The difference is so per-
<lb break="no"/>ceptible, on trial, as to render any further comment unnecessary.
<lb/>Monstrous Fraud.—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be
<lb/>retailed by small dealers, in this country, at 75 cents per pound,
<lb/>because they frequently cost that money in China, and no Importer
<lb/>in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a less prica
<lb/>than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages. T. F. Davies,
<lb/>Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner in
<lb/>which he saw the lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured and
<lb/>colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpowder and
<lb/>Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a combination of
<lb/>Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poison. Let pur-
<lb break="no"/>chasers therefore beware of adulterated teas, and deal with those
<lb/>venders whose characters and resources raise them above suspicion.
<lb/>Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas retailed at 75 cents
<lb/>per pound, and compare them with the genuine article sold by the
<lb/>Pekin Tea Company. No one, it is presumed, wishes to drink
<lb/>poison. The company have published a book, giving full details on
<lb/>this subject, which may be had at their warehouse, 75 Fulton street,
<lb/>free of charge.
<lb/>Recommendations.
<lb/>We drink Green Tea, and for many years have been paying one
<lb/>dollar per pound for it. But thanks to the Pekin Tea Company, we
<lb/>now get a better tea from them at 75 cents per pound. We drink one
<lb/>pound per week, by which we are now saving thirteen dollars per year,
<lb/>and enjoying better tea in the bargain. Commend us to the Pekin Tea
<lb/>Company, say we.—[Mirror.
<lb/>The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, are performing a great
<lb/>and good work, and will, in a few years, beyond all doubt, drive all the
<lb/>poor teas which have deluged this country, and defrauded consumers
<lb/>of the article, out of the market. They import none but pure and fra-<cb n="2"/>
<lb break="no"/>grant teas, and retail them by the single pound at wholesale prices.
<lb/>Families are always sure of obtaining good teas at this great tea ware-
<lb break="no"/>house, in quantities to suit their convenience, and at the same price
<lb/>that the merchant pays who buys to sell again.—[Daily True Sun.
<lb/>You may be sure of obtaining at all times, pure and highly flavored
<lb/>teas, by the single pound, at wholesale prices, of the Pekin Tea Com-
<lb break="no"/>pany, 75 Fulton street. They have probably the largest stock, and
<lb/>greatest variety of green and black teas, of any one establishment in
<lb/>the United States. They are doing a large business, and a great benefit
<lb/>to consumers of tea.—[Atlas.
<lb/>Heretofore it has been very difficult, indeed impossible, to always
<lb/>obtain good green and black teas; but now you have only to visit the
<lb/>ware-rooms of the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, to obtain as
<lb/>delicious and fragrant teas as you could wish for.—Daily Sun.
<lb/>If any of our readers desire to have good tea, they can obtain it of
<lb/>the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street.—[Mercury.
<lb/>A Word to Tea Drinkers.—The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton
<lb/>street, have imported into this market some five hundred thousand dol-
<lb break="no"/>lars worth of the finest grade of green and black teas, grown in the
<lb/>Celestial Empire, done up in all the various fancy packages that Chi-
<lb break="no"/>nese ingenuity can invent. It is a privilege to buy teas at this great
<lb/>establishment, and a luxury and comfort to drink them. They sell
<lb/>good teas only, and retail them at wholesale prices. Country merchants
<lb/>who wish to always sell good teas can always obtain them at this place,
<lb/>on reasonable terms.—[Emporium.
<lb/>The Pekin Tea Company.—We very cheerfully call the attention
<lb/>of all lovers of pure and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the
<lb/>great tea warehouse of this company. Our long acquaintance with the
<lb/>proprietors enables us to bespeak for them the entire confidence of the
<lb/>public. We know that their teas, both in quality and price, are all that
<lb/>is stated of them. Many a lover of the fragrant herb has been com-
<lb break="no"/>pelled to eschew the drinking of tea in consequence of its injurious
<lb/>effects, until at length he has become hopeless of finding, among any of
<lb/>the imported varieties of tea in our market, a kind which had not such
<lb/>an effect. In this, however, such persons will be agreeably disappointed.
<lb/>The Pekin Tea Company have commenced the importation of choice
<lb/>varieties of Garden Teas, of most delicious flavor—cultivated and
<lb/>picked with great care, which have heretofore never been introduced
<lb/>into this country, except as presents to importers. Among these they
<lb/>have an Oolong, mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we es-
<lb break="no"/>pecially recommend to all nervous persons. Its effect upon many of
<lb/>those who have tried it, is to make them confirmed tea-drinkers. Ladies
<lb/>who have tried it say they never before drank such tea. But all tastes
<lb/>can here be suited, with the great advantage over other stores of getting
<lb/>a pure article at wholesale price, however small the quantity. The
<lb/>company's warehouse is at 75 Fulton street.—[New World.
<lb/>Tea.—The Pekin Tea Company, No. 75Fulton street, unquestionably
<lb/>sell the best teas imported into this market. That they sell them
<lb/>cheaper than any other establishment, is a fact proven in a thousand
<lb/>instances since they have opened their store.
<lb/>We would advise our friends to call at this place, and if they don’t
<lb/>wish to buy, at least to obtain a little pamphlet, kept on their counter,
<lb/>entitled “Hints to Tea-Drinkers,” and therefrom learn a little useful
<lb/>information on the subject. The pamphlet is given gratis.—[Anglo-
<lb break="no"/>American.
<lb/>The finest specimens of green and black teas ever sold in this
<lb/>country, are imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street.
<lb/>Those who want good teas at reasonable prices, can always get them
<lb/>there.—[Tribune.
<lb/>We have tried the teas imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75
<lb/>Fulton street, and, if we live, will try them often. They are selling
<lb/>the most delicious teas we ever drank, and retail them at wholesale
<lb/>prices.—[Evening Post.	oct. 8.</ab></div>
