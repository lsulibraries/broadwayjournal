<lb/>Sister Mine.
<lb/>Sister mine—Sister mine!
<lb/>Why art so dear?
<lb/>Why throbs this heart of mine,
<lb/>Like the strong-tendrilled vine,
<lb/>Clinging so close to thine
<lb/>When thou art near,
<lb/>Sister mine?
<lb/>Sister mine—Sister mine!
<lb/>Why art so dear?
<lb/>Chill is this heart of mine,
<lb/>Till that sweet smile of thine
<lb/>Wakes it to life divine,
<lb/>When thou art near,
<lb/>Sister mine.
<lb/>Sister mine—Sister mine I
<lb/>Why art so dear?
<lb/>Light is this heart of mine,
<lb/>As is the sparkling wine
<lb/>Bright in its crimson-shine,
<lb/>When thou art near,
<lb/>Sister mine.
<lb/>Sister mine—Sister mine!
<lb/>Thou art so dear
<lb/>By that wierd spell of thine,
<lb/>Wreathed round this heart of mine
<lb/>Till our twin spirits twine
<lb/>When thou art near,
<lb/>Sister mine !	R. H. DANA
<lb/>The Spectacles.
<lb/>Many years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the
<lb/>idea of “ love at first sight;" but those who think, not
<lb/>less than those who feel deeply, have always advocated
<lb/>its existence. Modern discoveries, indeed, in what may
<lb/>be termed ethical magnetism or magnetœsthetics, render
<lb/>it probable that the most natural, and, consequently the
<lb/>truest and most intense of the human affections, are
<lb/>those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy
<lb/>—in a word, that the brightest and most enduring of the
<lb/>psychal fetters are those which are riveted by a glance.
<lb/>The confession I am about to make will add another to
<lb/>the already almost innumerable instances of the truth of
<lb/>the position.
<lb/>My story requires that I should be somewhat minute.
<lb/>I am still a very young man—not yet twenty-two years
<lb/>of age. My name, at present, is a very usual and rather
<lb/>plebeian one—Simpson. I say “at present;" for it is
<lb/>only lately that I have been so called—having legisla-
<lb break="no"/>tively adopted this surname within the last year, in order
<lb/>to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant male
<lb/>relative, Adolphus Simpson, Esq. The bequest was con-
<lb break="no"/>ditioned upon my taking the name of the testator;—the
<lb/>family, not the Christian name ; my Christian name is
<lb/>Napoleon Buonaparte—or, more properly, these are my
<lb/>first and middle appellations.
<lb/>I assumed the name, Simpson, with some reluctance,
<lb/>as in my true patronym, Froissart, I felt a very pardon-
<lb break="no"/>able pride; beleiving that I could trace a descent from
<lb/>the immortal author of the “ Chronicles.” While on
<lb/>the subject of names, by the bye, I may mention a singu-
<lb break="no"/>lar coincidence of sound attending the names of some of
<lb/>my immediate predecessors. My father was a Monsieur
<lb/>Froissart, of Paris. His wife, my mother, whom he mar-
<lb break="no"/>ried at fifteen, was a Mademoiselle Croissart, eldest
<lb/>daughter of Croissart the banker ; whose wife, again,
<lb/>being only sixteen when married, was the eldest daughter
<lb/>of one Victor Voissart. Monsieur Voissart, very singu-
<lb break="no"/>larly, had married a lady of similar name—a Mademoi-
<lb break="no"/>selle Moissart. She, too, was quite a child when mar-
<lb break="no"/>ried ; and her mother, also, Madame Moissart, was only
<lb/>fourteen when led to the altar. These early marriages
<lb/>are usual in France. Here, however, are Moissart, Vois-
<lb break="no"/>sart, Croissart, and Froissart, all in the direct line of des-
<lb break="no"/>cent. My own name, though, as I say, became Simpson,
<lb/>by act of Legislature, and with so much repugnance on
<lb/>my part that, at one period, I actually hesitated about
<lb/>accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying pro-
<lb break="no"/>viso attached.
<lb/>As to personal endowments I am by no means deficient.
<lb/>On the contrary, I believe that I am well made, and pos-
<lb break="no"/>sess what nine tenths of the world would call a handsome
<lb/>face. In height I am five feet eleven. My hair is black
<lb/>and curling. My nose is sufficiently good. My eyes are
<lb/>large and gray ; and although, in fact, they are weak to
<lb/>a very inconvenient degree, still no defect in this regard
<lb/>would be suspected from their appearance. The weak-
<lb break="no"/>ness, itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and
<lb/>I have resorted to every remedy—short of wearing
<lb/>glasses. Being youthful and good-looking, I naturally
<lb/>dislike these, and have resolutely refused to employ them.
<lb/>I know nothing, indeed, which so disfigures the counte-
<lb break="no"/>nance of a young person, or so impresses every feature
<lb/>with an air of demureness, if not altogether of sancti-
<lb break="no"/>moniousness and of age. An eye-glass, on the other
<lb/>hand, has a savor of downright foppery and affectation.
<lb/>I have hitherto managed as well as I could without
<lb/>either. But something too much of these merely person-
<lb break="no"/>al details, which, after all, are of little importance. I
<lb/>will content myself with saying, in addition, that my
<lb/>temperament is sanguine, rash, ardent, enthusiastic—and
<lb/>that all my life I have been a devoted admirer of the
<lb/>women.
<lb/>One night, last winter, I entered a box at the P——
<lb/>theatre, in company with a friend, Mr. Talbot. It was
<lb/>an opera night, and the bills presented a very rare at-
<lb break="no"/>traction, so that the house was excessively crowded.
<lb/>We were in time, however, to obtain the front seats
<pb  n="300"/>
<lb/>which had been reserved for us, and into which, with
<lb/>some little difficulty, we elbowed our way.
<lb/>For two hours, my companion, who was a musical
<lb/>fanatico, gave his undivided attention to the stage ; and,
<lb/>in the meantime, I amused myself by observing the au-
<lb break="no"/>dience, which consisted, in chief part, of the very élite of
<lb/>the city. Having satisfied myself upon this point, I was
<lb/>about turning my eyes to the prima donna, when they
<lb/>were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the pri-
<lb break="no"/>vate boxes which had escaped my observation.
<lb/>If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the in-
<lb break="no"/>tense emotion with which I regarded this figure. It
<lb/>was that of a female, the most exquisite I had ever be-
<lb break="no"/>held. The face was so far turned towards the stage that,
<lb/>for some minutes, I could not obtain a view of it but
<lb/>the form was divine—no other word can sufficiently ex-
<lb break="no"/>press its magnificent proportion, and even the term “di-
<lb break="no"/>vine” seems ridiculously feeble as I write it.
<lb/>The magic of a lovely form in woman—the necroman-
<lb break="no"/>cy of female gracefulness—was always a power which
<lb/>I had found it impossible to resist; but here was grace per-
<lb break="no"/>sonified, incarnate, the beau ideal of my wildest and most
<lb/>enthusiastic visions. The figure, almost all of which the
<lb/>construction of the box permitted to be seen, was some-
<lb break="no"/>what above the medium height, and nearly approached,
<lb/>without positively reaching, the majestic. Its perfect
<lb/>fulness and tournure were delicious. The head, of
<lb/>which only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that
<lb/>of the Greek Psyche, and was rather displayed than con-
<lb break="no"/>cealed by an elegant cap of gaze äerienne, which put me
<lb/>in mind of the ventum textilem of Apuleius. The right
<lb/>arm hung over the balustrade of the box, and thrilled
<lb/>every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry.
<lb/>Its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open
<lb/>sleeves now in fashion. This extended but little below
<lb/>the elbow. Beneath it was worn an under one of some
<lb/>frail material, close-fitting, and terminated by a cuff of
<lb/>rich lace which fell gracefully over the top of the hand,
<lb/>revealing only the delicate lingers, upon one of which
<lb/>sparkled a diamond ring which I at once saw was of ex-
<lb break="no"/>traordinary value. The admirable roundness of the wrist
<lb/>was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and
<lb/>which also was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent
<lb/>aigrette of jewels—telling, in words that could not be
<lb/>mistaken, at once of the wealth and fastidious taste of the
<lb/>wearer.
<lb/>I gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an
<lb/>hour, as if I had been suddenly converted to stone; and,
<lb/>during this period, I felt the full force and truth of all
<lb/>that has been said or sung concerning “love at first
<lb/>sight.” My feelings were totally different from any
<lb/>which I had hitherto experienced, in the presence of even
<lb/>the most celebrated specimens of female loveliness. An
<lb/>unaccountable, and what I am compelled to consider a
<lb/>magnetic sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, not
<lb/>only my vision, but my whole powers of thought and
<lb/>feeling upon the admirable object before me. I saw—I
<lb/>felt—I knew that I was deeply, madly, irrevocably in
<lb/>love—and this even before seeing the face of the person
<lb/>beloved. So intense, indeed, was the passion that con-
<lb break="no"/>sumed me, that I really believe it would have received
<lb/>little if any abatement had the features, yet unseen,
<lb/>proved of merely ordinary character; so anomalous is
<lb/>the nature of the only true love—of the love at first sight
<lb/>—and so little really dependent is it upon the external
<lb/>conditions which only seem to create and control it.
<lb/>While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely
<lb/>vision, a sudden disturbance among the audience caused
<lb/>her to turn her head partially towards me, so that I be-
<lb break="no"/>held the entire profile of the face. Its beauty even ex-
<lb break="no"/>ceeded my anticipations—and yet there was something
<lb/>about it which disappointed me without my being able
<lb/>to tell exactly what it was. I said “disappointed,” but
<lb/>this is not altogether the word. My sentiments were at
<lb/>once quieted and exalted. They partook less of transport
<lb/>and more of calm enthusiasm—of enthusiastic repose.
<lb/>This state of feeling arose, perhaps, front the Madonna-
<lb break="no"/>like and matronly air of the face ; and yet I at once un-
<lb break="no"/>derstood that it could not have arisen entirely from this.
<lb/>There was something else—some mystery which I could
<lb/>not develope—some expression about the countenance
<lb/>which slightly disturbed me while it greatly heightened
<lb/>my interest. In fact, I was just in that condition of
<lb/>mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for
<lb/>any act of extravagance. Had the lady been alone, I
<lb/>should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted
<lb/>her at all hazards; but, fortunately, she was attended by
<lb/>two companions—a gentleman, and a strikingly beauti-
<lb break="no"/>ful woman, to all appearance a few years younger than
<lb/>herself.
<lb/>I revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which
<lb/>I might obtain, hereafter, an introduction to the elder
<lb/>lady, or, for the present, at all events, a more distinct
<lb/>view of her beauty. I would have removed my position
<lb/>to one nearer her own : but the crowded state of the
<lb/>theatre rendered this impossible, and the stern decrees of
<lb/>Fashion, had, of late, imperatively prohibited the use of
<lb/>the opera-glass, in a case such as this, even had I been
<lb/>so fortunate as to have one with me—but I had not, and
<lb/>was thus in despair.
<lb/>At length I bethought me of applying to my compan-
<lb break="no"/>ion.
<lb/>“ Talbot,” I said, “ you have an opera-glass. Let me
<lb/>have it.”
<lb/>“An opera-glass! no! what do you suppose I would
<lb/>be doing with an opera-glass ?" Here he turned im-
<lb break="no"/>patiently towards the stage.
<lb/>“But, Talbot,” I continued, pulling him by the shoul-
<lb break="no"/>der, “ listen to me. will you ? Do you see the stage-box?
<lb/>—there! no, the next—did you ever behold as lovely a
<lb/>woman ?"
<lb/>“ She is very beautiful, no doubt,” he said.
<lb/>"I wonder who she can be ?”
<lb/>“Why, in the name of all that is angelic, don’t you
<lb/>know who she is? 'Not to know her argues yourself
<lb/>unknown.’ She is the celebrated Madame Lalande—the
<lb/>beauty of the day par excellence, and the talk of the
<lb/>whole town. Immensely wealthy, too—a widow and a
<lb/>great match—has just arrived from Paris.”
<lb/>“ Do you know her ?”
<lb/>“Yes: I have the honor.”
<lb/>“ Will you introduce me ?”
<lb/>“Assuredly; with the greatest pleasure; when shall
<lb/>it be?”
<lb/>“To-morrow, at one, I will call upon you at B——’s."
<lb/>“ Very good: and now do hold your tongue, if you
<lb/>can.”
<lb/>In this latter respect I was forced to take Talbot's ad-
<lb break="no"/>vice; for he remained obstinately deaf to every further
<lb/>question or suggestion, and occupied himself exclusively
<lb/>for the rest of the evening, with what was transacting
<lb/>upon the stage.
<lb/>In the mean time I kept my eyes riveted on Madame
<lb/>Lalande, and at length had the good fortune to obtain a
<lb/>full front view of her face. It was exquisitely lovely—
<lb/>this, of course, my heart had told me before, even had
<pb n="301"/>
<lb/>not Talbot fully satisfied me upon the point—but still the
<lb/>unintelligible something disturbed me. I finally conclu-
<lb break="no"/>ded that my senses were impressed by a certain air of
<lb/>gravity, sadness, or still more properly, of weariness,
<lb/>which took something from the youth and freshness of
<lb/>the countenance, only to endow it with a seraphic tender-
<lb break="no"/>ness and majesty, and thus, of course, to my enthusiastic
<lb/>and romantic temperament, with an interest tenfold.
<lb/>While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to
<lb/>my great trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on
<lb/>the part of the lady, that she had become suddenly aware
<lb/>of the intensity of my gaze. Still, I was absolutely fas-
<lb break="no"/>cinated, and could not withdraw it, even for an instant.
<lb/>She turned aside her face, and again I saw only the chis-
<lb break="no"/>selled contour of the back portion of the head. After
<lb/>some minutes, as if urged by curiosity to see if I was
<lb/>still looking, she gradually brought her face again around
<lb/>and again encountered my burning gaze. Her large dark
<lb/>eves fell instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek.
<lb/>But what was my astonishment at perceiving that she not
<lb/>only did not a second time avert her head, but that she ac-
<lb break="no"/>tually took from her girdle a double eye-glass—elevated it
<lb/>—adjusted it—and then regarded me through it, intently
<lb/>and deliberately, for the space of several minutes.
<lb/>Had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet I could not have
<lb/>been more thoroughly astounded—astounded only—not
<lb/>offended or disgusted in the slightest degree ; although
<lb/>an action so bold in any other woman, would have been
<lb/>likely to offend or disgust. But the whole thing was done
<lb/>with so much quietude—so much nonchalance—so much
<lb/>repose—with so evident an air of the highest breeding, in
<lb/>short—that nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible,
<lb/>and my sole sentiments were those of admiration and sur-
<lb break="no"/>prise.
<lb/>I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass,
<lb/>she had seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of
<lb/>my person, and was withdrawing the instrument, when,
<lb/>as if struck by a second thought, she resumed it, and so
<lb/>continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space
<lb/>of several minutes--for five minutes, at the very least, I
<lb/>am sure.
<lb/>This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, at-
<lb break="no"/>tracted very general observation, and gave rise to an in-
<lb break="no"/>definite movement, or buzz, among the audience, which
<lb/>lor a moment filled me with confusion, but produced no
<lb/>visible effect upon the countenance of Madame Lalande.
<lb/>Having satisfied her curiosity—if such it was she
<lb/>dropped the glass, and quietly gave her attention again
<lb/>to the stage ; her profile now being turned toward my-
<lb break="no"/>self, as before. I continued to watch her unremittingly,
<lb/>although I was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing.
<lb/>Presently I saw the head slowly and slightly change its
<lb/>position ; and soon I became convinced that the lady,
<lb/>while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact, atten-
<lb break="no"/>tively regarding myself. It is needless to say what effect
<lb/>this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had
<lb/>upon my excitable mind.
<lb/>Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an
<lb/>hour, the fair object of my passion addressed the gentle-
<lb break="no"/>man who attended her, and, while she spoke, I saw dis-
<lb break="no"/>tinctly, by the glances of both, that the conversation had
<lb/>reference to myself.
<lb/>Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned to-
<lb break="no"/>wards the stage, and, for a few minutes, seemed absorbed
<lb/>in the performances. At the expiration of this period,
<lb/>however, I was thrown into an extremity of agitation by-
<lb break="no"/>seeing her unfold, for the second time, the eye-glass
<lb/>which hung at her side, fully confront me as before, and,
<lb/>disregarding the renewed buzz of the audience, survey
<lb/>me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous compo-
<lb break="no"/>sure which had previously so delighted and confounded
<lb/>my soul.
<lb/>This extraordinary behaviour, by throwing me into a
<lb/>perfect fever of excitement—into an absolute delirium
<lb/>of love—served rather to embolden than disconcert me.
<lb/>In the mad intensity of my devotion, I forgot everything
<lb/>but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision
<lb/>which confronted my gaze. Watching my opportunity,
<lb/>when I thought the audience were fully engaged with
<lb/>the opera, I at length caught the eyes of Madame La-
<lb break="no"/>lande, and, upon the instant, made a slight but unmistake-
<lb break="no"/>able bow.
<lb/>She blushed very deeply—then averted her eyes—then
<lb/>slowly and cautiously looked around, apparently to see if
<lb/>my rash action had been noticed—then leaned over to-
<lb break="no"/>wards the gentleman who sat by her side.
<lb/>I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had
<lb/>committed, and expected nothing less than instant expo-
<lb break="no"/>sure; while a vision of pistols upon the morrow floated
<lb/>rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain. I was
<lb/>greatly and immediately relieved, however, when I saw
<lb/>the lady merely hand the gentleman a playbill, without
<lb/>speaking ; but the reader may form some feeble concep-
<lb break="no"/>tion of my astonishment—of my profound amazement—
<lb/>my delirious bewilderment of heart and soul—when, in-
<lb break="no"/>stantly afterwards, having again glanced furtively around,
<lb/>she allowed her bright eyes to settle fully and steadily
<lb/>upon my own, and then, with a faint smile, disclosing a
<lb/>bright line of her pearly teeth, made two distinct, pointed
<lb/>and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head.
<lb/>It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy—upon my
<lb/>transport—upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart. If ever
<lb/>man was mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at
<lb/>that moment. I loved. This was my first love—so I felt
<lb/>it to be. It was love supreme—indescribable. It was
<lb/>“love at first sight;" and at first sight too, it had been
<lb/>appreciated and—returned.
<lb/>Yes, returned. How and why should I doubt it for an
<lb/>instant ? What other construction could I possibly put
<lb/>upon such conduct, on the part of a lady so beautiful—so
<lb/>wealthy—evidently so accomplished—of so high breed-
<lb break="no"/>ing—of so lofty a position in society—in every regard so
<lb/>entirely respectable as I felt assured was Madame La-
<lb break="no"/>lande ? Yes, she loved me—she returned the enthusiasm
<lb/>of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind—as uncompro-
<lb break="no"/>misins—as uncalculating—as abandoned—and as utterly
<lb/>unbounded as my own ! These delicious fancies and in-
<lb break="no"/>flections, however, were now interrupted by the falling of
<lb/>the drop-curtain. The audience arose ; and the usual tu-
<lb break="no"/>mult immediately supervened. Quitting Talbot abruptly,
<lb/>I made every effort to force my way into closer proximity
<lb/>with Madame Lalande. Having failed in this, on ac
<lb/>count of the crowd, I at length gave up the chase, and
<lb/>bent my steps homewards ; consoling myself for my dis-
<lb break="no"/>appointment in not having been able to touch even the
<lb/>hem of her robe, by the reflection that I should be intro-
<lb break="no"/>duced by Talbot, in due form, upon the morrow.
<lb/>This morrow at last came ; that is to say, a day finally
<lb/>dawned upon a long and weary night of impatience ; and
<lb/>then the hours until “ one” were snail-paced, dreary and
<lb/>innumerable. But even Stamboul, it is said, shall have
<lb/>an end, and there came an end to this long delay. The
<lb/>clock struck. As the last echo ceased, I stepped into
<lb/>B——'s and enquired for Talbot.
<pb  n="302"/>
<lb/>“ Out,” said the footman—Talbot’s own.
<lb/>“ Out!” I replied, staggering back half a dozen paces—
<lb/>"let me tell you, my fine fellow, that this thing is tho-
<lb break="no"/>roughly impossible and impracticable ; Mr. Talbot is not
<lb/>out. What do you mean ?”
<lb/>“Nothing, sir ; only Mr. Talbot is not in. That’s all.
<lb/>He rode over to S——, immediately after breakfast, and
<lb/>left word that he would not be in town again for a week.”
<lb/>I stood petrified with horror and rage. I endeavored
<lb/>to reply, but my tongue refused its office. At length I
<lb/>turned on my heel, livid with wrath, and inwardly con-
<lb break="no"/>signing the whole tribe of the Talbots to the innermost
<lb/>regions of Erebus. It was evident that my consider-
<lb break="no"/>ate friend, il fanatico, had quite forgotten his appoint-
<lb break="no"/>ment with myself—had forgotten it as soon as it was
<lb/>made. At no time was he a very scrupulous man of his
<lb/>word. There was no help for it; so smothering my vexa-
<lb break="no"/>tion as well as I could, I strolled moodily up the street,
<lb/>propounding futile inquiries about Madame Lalande to
<lb/>every male acquaintance I met. By report she was known,
<lb/>I found, to all—to many by sight—but she had been in
<lb/>town only a few weeks, and there were very few, there-
<lb break="no"/>fore, who claimed her personal acquaintance. These
<lb/>few, being still comparatively strangers, could not, or
<lb/>would not, lake the liberty of introducing me through the
<lb/>formality of a morning call. While I stood thus, in des-
<lb break="no"/>pair, conversing with a trio of friends upon the all absorb-
<lb break="no"/>ing subject of my heart, it so happened that the subject
<lb/>itself passed by.
<lb/>“ As I live, there she is!” cried one.
<lb/>“Surpassingly beautiful!’’ exclaimed a second.
<lb/>“ An angel upon earth !” ejaculated a third.
<lb/>I looked ; and, in an open carriage which approached
<lb/>us, passing slowly down the street, sat the enchanting
<lb/>vision of the opera, accompanied by the younger lady
<lb/>who had occupied a portion of her box.
<lb/>“ Her companion also wears remarkably well,” said the
<lb/>one of my trio who had spoken first.
<lb/>“Astonishingly,” said the second ; “still quite a bril-
<lb break="no"/>liant air; but art will do wonders. Upon my word, she
<lb/>looks better than she did at Paris five years ago. A beau-
<lb break="no"/>tiful woman still;—don’t you think so, Froissart?—Simp-
<lb break="no"/>son, I mean.”
<lb/>"Still!” said I, “ and why shouldn’t she be ? But
<lb/>compared with her friend she is as a rushlight to the
<lb/>evening star—a glow-worm to Antares.”
<lb/>“ Ha! ha ! ha !—why, Simpson, you have an astonish-
<lb break="no"/>ing tact at making discoveries—original ones, I mean.”
<lb/>And here we separated, while one of the trio began hum-
<lb break="no"/>ming a gay vaudeville, of which I caught only the lines—
<lb/>Ninon, Ninon, Ninon à bas—
<lb/>A bas Ninon De L’Enclos!
<lb/>During this little scene, however, one thing had served
<lb/>greatly to console me, although it fed the passion by
<lb/>which I was consumed. As the carriage of Madame La-
<lb break="no"/>lande rolled by our group, I had observed that she recog-
<lb break="no"/>nized me; and more than this, she had blessed me, by
<lb/>the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles, with no equi-
<lb break="no"/>vocal mark of the recognition.
<lb/>As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all
<lb/>hope of it, until such time as Talbot should think proper
<lb/>to return from the country. In the meantime I persever-
<lb break="no"/>ingly frequented every reputable place of public amuse-
<lb break="no"/>ment ; and, at length, at the theatre, where I first saw
<lb/>her, I had the supreme bliss of meeting her, and of ex-
<lb break="no"/>changing glances with her once again. This did not oc-
<lb break="no"/>cur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight. Every day,
<lb/>in the interim, I had enquired for Talbot at his hotel, and
<lb/>every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the
<lb/>everlasting “ Not come home yet” of his footman.
<lb/>Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a
<lb/>condition little short of madness. Madame Lalande, I
<lb/>had been told, was a Parisian—had lately arrived from
<lb/>Paris—might she not suddenly return ?—return before
<lb/>Talbot came back—and might she not be thus lost to me
<lb/>forever? The thought was too terrible to bear. Since
<lb/>my future happiness was at issue, I resolved to act with
<lb/>a manly decision. In a word, upon the breaking up of
<lb/>the play, I traced the lady to her residence, noted the ad-
<lb break="no"/>dress, and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate
<lb/>letter, in which I poured out my whole heart.
<lb/>I spoke boldly, freely—in a word, I spoke with passion.
<lb/>I concealed nothing—nothing even of my weakness. I
<lb/>alluded to the romantic circumstance of our first meet-
<lb break="no"/>ing—even to the glances which had passed between us.
<lb/>I went so far as to say that I felt assured of her love ;
<lb/>while I offered this assurance, and my own intensity of
<lb/>devotion, as two excuses for my otherwise unpardonable
<lb/>conduct. As a third, I spoke of my fear that she might
<lb/>quit the city before I could have the opportunity of a for-
<lb break="no"/>mal introduction. I concluded the most wildly enthusi-
<lb break="no"/>astic epistle ever penned, with a frank declaration of my
<lb/>wordly circumstances—of my affluence—and with an offer
<lb/>of my heart and of my hand.
<lb/>In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply. After
<lb/>what seemed the lapse of a century it came.
<lb/>Yes, actually came. Romantic as all this may appear,
<lb/>I really received a letter from Madame Lalande—the
<lb/>beautiful, the wealthy, the idolized Madame Lalande.—
<lb/>Her eyes—her magnificent eyes—had not belied her noble
<lb/>heart. Like a true Frenchwoman, as she was, she had obey-
<lb break="no"/>ed the frank dictates of her reason—the generous impul-
<lb break="no"/>ses of her nature—despising the conventional pruderies
<lb/>of the world. She had not scorned my proposals. She
<lb/>had not sheltered herself in silence. She had not return-
<lb break="no"/>ed my letter unopened. She had even sent me, in reply,
<lb/>one penned by her own exquisite fingers. It ran thus:
<lb/>Monsieur Simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle
<lb/>tong of his contree so vell as might It is only de late dat I am
<lb/>arrive, and not yet ave de opportunity for to—l’étudier.
<lb/>Vid dis apologie for de maniere, I vill now say dat, hélas !—
<lb/>Monsieur Simpson ave guess but de too true. Need I say de more?
<lb/>Hélas! am I not ready speak de too moshe?
<lb/>Eugenie Lalande.
<lb/>This noble-spirited note I kissed a million times, and
<lb/>committed, no doubt, on its account, a thousand other ex-
<lb break="no"/>travagances that have now escaped my memory. Still
<lb/>Talbot would not return. Alas! could he have formed
<lb/>even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence occa-
<lb break="no"/>sioned his friend, would not his sympathizing nature have
<lb/>flown immediately to my relief? Still, however, he came
<lb/>not. I wrote. He replied. He was detained by urgent
<lb/>business—but would shortly return. He begged me not
<lb/>to be impatient—to moderate my transports—to read
<lb/>soothing books—to drink nothing stronger than Hock—
<lb/>and to bring the consolations of philosophy to my aid.
<lb/>The fool! if he could not come himself, why, in the
<lb/>name of every thing rational, could he not have enclosed
<lb/>me a letter of presentation? I wrote again, entreating
<lb/>him to forward one forthwith. My letter was returned
<lb/>by that footman, with the following endorsement in
<lb/>pencil. The scoundrel had joined his master in the coun-
<lb break="no"/>try:
<lb/>Left S——yesterday, for parts unknown—did not say where—
<pb n="303"/>
<lb/>or when be back—so thought best to return letter, knowing your
<lb/>handwriting, and as how you is always, more or less, in a hurry —
<lb/>Yours, sincerely,	Stubbs.
<lb/>After this, it is needless to say, that I devoted to the
<lb/>infernal deities both master and valet;—but there was
<lb/>little use in anger, and no consolation at all in complaint.
<lb/>But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional au-
<lb break="no"/>dacity. Hitherto it had served me well, and I now re-
<lb break="no"/>solved to make it avail me to the end. Besides, after the
<lb/>correspondence which had passed between us, what act
<lb/>of mere informality could I commit, within bounds, that
<lb/>ought to be regarded as indecorous by Madame Lalande?
<lb/>Since the affair of the letter, I had been in the habit of
<lb/>watching her house, and thus discovered that, about twi-
<lb break="no"/>light, it was her custom to promenade, attended only by
<lb/>a negro in livery, in a public square overlooked by her
<lb/>windows. Here, amid the luxuriant and shadowing
<lb/>groves, in the gray gloom of a sweet midsummer even-
<lb break="no"/>ing, I observed my opportunity and accosted her.
<lb/>The better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did
<lb/>this with the assured air of an old and familiar acquain-
<lb break="no"/>tance. With a presence of mind truly Parisian, she took
<lb/>the cue at once, and, to greet me, held out the most be-
<lb break="no"/>witchingly little of hands. The valet at once fell into
<lb/>the rear; and now, with hearts full to overflowing, we
<lb/>discoursed long and unreservedly of our love.
<lb/>As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently
<lb/>than she wrote it, our conversation was necessarily in
<lb/>French. In this sweet tongue, so adapted to passion, I
<lb/>gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my nature,
<lb/>and with all the eloquence I could command, besought
<lb/>her consent to an immediate marriage.
<lb/>At this impatience she smiled. She urged the old sto-
<lb break="no"/>ry of decorum—that bug-bear which deters so many from
<lb/>bliss until the opportunity for bliss has forever gone by.
<lb/>I had most imprudently made it known among my friends,
<lb/>she observed, that I desired her acquaintance—thus that
<lb/>I did not possess it—thus, again, there was no possibili-
<lb break="no"/>ty of concealing the date of our first knowledge of each
<lb/>other. And then she adverted, with a blush, to the ex-
<lb break="no"/>treme recency of this date. To wed immediately would
<lb/>be improper—would be indecorous—would be outre.—
<lb/>All this she said with a charming air of naivete which
<lb/>enraptured while it grieved and convinced me. She went
<lb/>even so far as to accuse me, laughingly, of rashness—of
<lb/>imprudence. She bade me remember that I really even
<lb/>knew not who she was—what were her prospects, her
<lb/>connexions, her standing in society. She begged me, but
<lb/>with a sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my
<lb/>love an infatuation—a will ’o the wisp—a fancy or fantasy
<lb/>of the moment—a baseless and unstable creation rather of
<lb/>the imagination than of the heart. These things she
<lb/>uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered
<lb/>darkly and more darkly around us—and then, with a gen-
<lb break="no"/>tle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single
<lb/>sweet instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared.
<lb/>I replied as best I could—as only a true lover can. I
<lb/>spoke at length, and perseveringly, of my devotion, of
<lb/>my passion—of her exceeding beauty, and of my own en-
<lb break="no"/>thusiastic admiration. In conclusion, I dwelt, with a
<lb/>convincing energy, upon the perils that encompass the
<lb/>course of love—that course of true love that never did
<lb/>run smooth, and thus deduced the manifest danger of
<lb/>rendering that course unnecessarily long.
<lb/>This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor
<lb/>of her determination. She relented; but there was yet
<lb/>an obstacle, she said, which she felt assured I had not
<lb/>properly considered. This was a delicate point—for a
<lb/>woman to urge, especially so ; in mentioning it, she saw
<lb/>that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings ; still, for
<lb/>me, every sacrifice should be made. She alluded to the
<lb/>topic of age. Was I aware—was I fully aware of the
<lb/>discrepancy between us ? That the age of the husband
<lb/>should surpass by a few years—even by fifteen or twenty
<lb/>—the age of the wife, was regarded by the world as ad-
<lb break="no"/>missible, and, indeed, as even proper ; but she had always
<lb/>entertained the belief that the years of the wife should
<lb/>never exceed in number those of the husband. A dis-
<lb break="no"/>crepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too frequently,
<lb/>alas ! to a life of unhappiness. Now she was aware that
<lb/>my own age did not exceed two and twenty; and I, on the
<lb/>contrary, perhaps, was not aware that the years of my
<lb/>Eugenie extended very considerably beyond that sum.
<lb/>About all this there was a nobility of soul—a dignity of
<lb/>candor—which delighted—which enchanted me—which
<lb/>eternally rivetted my chains. I could scarcely restrain
<lb/>the excessive transport which possessed me.
<lb/>“My sweetest Eugenie,” I cried, “what is all this
<lb/>about which you are discoursing ? Your years surpass
<lb/>in some measure my own. But what then ? The cus-
<lb break="no"/>toms of the world are so many conventional follies. To
<lb/>those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a
<lb/>year from an hour ? I am twenty-two, you say; granted:
<lb/>indeed you may as well call me, at once, twenty-three.
<lb/>Now you yourself, my dearest Eugenie, can have num-
<lb break="no"/>bered no more than—can have numbered no more than—-
<lb break="no"/>no more than—than—than—than—”
<lb/>Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that
<lb/>Madame Lalande would interrupt me by supplying
<lb/>her true age. But a Frenchwoman is seldom direct, and
<lb/>has always, by way of answer to an embarrassing query,
<lb/>some little practical reply of her own. In the present
<lb/>instance Eugenie, who, for a few moments past, had
<lb/>seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at
<lb/>length let fall upon the grass a miniature, which I imme-
<lb break="no"/>diately picked up and presented to her.
<lb/>“Keep it!” she said, with one of her most ravishing
<lb/>smiles. “ Keep it for my sake—for the sake of her whom
<lb/>it too flatteringly represents. Besides, upon the back of
<lb/>the trinket, you may discover, perhaps, the very informa-
<lb break="no"/>tion you seem to desire. It is now, to be sure, growing
<lb/>rather dark—but you can examine it at your leisure in the
<lb/>morning. In the mean time, you shall be my escort home
<lb/>to-night. My friends are about holding a little musical
<lb/>levée. I can promise you, too, some good singing. We
<lb/>French are not nearly so punctilious as you Americans,
<lb/>and I shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the
<lb/>character of an old acquaintance."
<lb/>With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home.
<lb/>The mansion was quite a fine one, and, I believe, furnish-
<lb break="no"/>ed in good taste. Of this latter point, however, I am
<lb/>scarcely qualified to judge; for it was just dark as we ar-
<lb break="no"/>rived ; and in American mansions of the better sort, lights
<lb/>seldom, during the heat of summer, make their appear-
<lb break="no"/>ance at this, the most pleasant period of the day. In
<lb/>about an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a single shaded
<lb/>solar lamp was lit in the principal drawing-room ; and
<lb/>this apartment, I could thus see, was arranged with unu-
<lb break="no"/>sual good taste and even splendor ; but two other rooms
<lb/>of the suite, and in which the company chiefly assembled,
<lb/>remained, during the whole evening, in a very agreeable
<lb/>shadow. This is a well conceived custom, giving the
<lb/>party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which
<pb  n="304"/>
<lb/>our friends over the water could not do better than im-
<lb break="no"/>mediately adopt.
<lb/>The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most
<lb/>delicious of my life. Madame Lalande had not over-
<lb break="no"/>rated the musical abilities of her friends ; and the singing
<lb/>I here heard I had never heard excelled in any private
<lb/>circle out of Vienna. The instrumental performers were
<lb/>many and of superior talents. The vocalists were chiefly
<lb/>ladies, and no individual sang less than well. At length,
<lb/>upon a peremptory call for “ Madame Lalande,” she arose
<lb/>at once, without affectation or demur, from the chaise
<lb/>longue upon which she had sate by my side, and, accom-
<lb break="no"/>panied by one or two gentlemen and her female friend of
<lb/>the opera, repaired to the piano in the main drawing-room.
<lb/>I would have escorted her myself; but felt that, under
<lb/>the circumstances of my introduction to the house, I had
<lb/>better remain unobserved where I was. I was thus depri-
<lb break="no"/>ved of the pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing
<lb/>her, sing.
<lb/>The impression she produced upon the company seemed
<lb/>electrical—but the effect upon myself was something even
<lb/>more. I know not how adequately to describe it. It arose
<lb/>in part, no doubt, from the sentiment of love with which
<lb/>I was imbued ; but chiefly from my conviction of the ex-
<lb break="no"/>treme sensibility of the singer. It is beyond the reach of
<lb/>art to endow either air or recitative with more impas-
<lb break="no"/>sioned expression than was hers. Her utterance of the
<lb/>romance in Otello—the tone with which she gave the
<lb/>words “Sul mio sasso," in the Capuletti—is ringing in
<lb/>my memory yet. Her lower tones were absolutely mirac-
<lb break="no"/>ulous. Her voice embraced three complete octaves,
<lb/>extending from the contralto D to the D upper soprano, and,
<lb/>though sufficiently powerful to have filled the San Carlos,
<lb/>executed, with the minutest precision, every difficulty of
<lb/>vocal composition—ascending and descending scales, ca-
<lb break="no"/>dences, or fiorituri. In the finale of the Sonnambula, she
<lb/>brought about a most remarkable effect at the words—
<lb/>Ah ! non guinge uman pensiero
<lb/>Al contento ond ’io son piena.
<lb/>Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the ori-
<lb break="no"/>ginal phrase of Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to
<lb/>the tenor G, when, by a rapid transition, she struck the
<lb/>G above the treble stave, springing over an interval of
<lb/>two octaves.
<lb/>Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal
<lb/>execution, she resumed her seat by my side ; when I
<lb/>expressed to her, in terms of the deepest enthusiasm, my
<lb/>delight at her performance. Of my surprise I said no-
<lb break="no"/>thing, and yet was I most unfeignedly surprised ; for a
<lb/>certain feebleness, or rather a certain tremulous indecis-
<lb break="no"/>ion of voice in ordinary conversation, had prepared me to
<lb/>anticipate that, in singing, she would not acquit herself
<lb/>with any remarkable ability.
<lb/>Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted,
<lb/>and totally unreserved. She made me relate many of the
<lb/>earlier passages of my life, and listened with breathless
<lb/>attention, to every word of the narrative. I concealed
<lb/>nothing—I felt that I had a right to conceal nothing from
<lb/>her confiding affection. Encouraged by her candor upon
<lb/>the delicate point of her age, I entered, with perfect frank-
<lb break="no"/>ness, not only into a detail of my many minor vices, but
<lb/>made full confession of those moral and even of those
<lb/>physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in demand-
<lb break="no"/>ing so much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer
<lb/>an evidence of love. I touched upon my college indiscre-
<lb break="no"/>tions—upon my extravagances—upon my carousals—upon
<lb/>my debts—upon my flirtations. I even went so far as to
<lb/>speak of a slightly hectic cough with which, at one time,
<lb/>I had been troubled—of a chronic rheumatism—of a
<lb/>twinge of hereditary gout—and, in conclusion, of the dis-
<lb break="no"/>agreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully con-
<lb break="no"/>cealed, weakness of my eyes.
<lb/>“ Upon this latter point,” said Madame Lalande, laugh-
<lb break="no"/>ingly, “ you have been surely injudicious in coming to
<lb/>confession ; for, without the confession, I take it for
<lb/>granted that no one would have accused you of the crime.
<lb/>By the by’” she continued, “ have you any recollection’’
<lb/>—and here I fancied that a blush, even through the gloom
<lb/>of the apartment, became distinctly visible upon her cheek
<lb/>—“ have you any recollection, mon cher ami, of this little
<lb/>ocular assistant which now depends from my neck ?”
<lb/>As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical
<lb/>double eye-glass, which had so overwhelmed me with
<lb/>confusion at the opera.
<lb/>“ Full well—alas I do I remember it,” I exclaimed,
<lb/>pressing passionately the delicate hand which offered the
<lb/>glasses for my inspection. They formed a complex and
<lb/>magnificent toy, richly chased and filagreed, and gleaming
<lb/>with jewels, which, even in the deficient light, I could
<lb/>not help perceiving were of high value.
<lb/>“Eh bien! mon ami," she resumed with a certain em-
<lb break="no"/>pressement of manner that rather surprised me—“Eh bien,
<lb/>mon ami, you have earnestly besought of me a favor
<lb/>which you have been pleased to denominate priceless. You
<lb/>have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow. Should
<lb/>I yield to your entreaties—and, I may add, to the plead-
<lb break="no"/>ings of my own bosom—would I not be entitled to demand
<lb/>of you a very—a very little boon in return ?”
<lb/>“ Name it!” I exclaimed with an energy that had
<lb/>nearly drawn upon us the observation of the company,
<lb/>and restrained by their presence alone from throwing my-
<lb break="no"/>self impetuously at her feet. “ Name it, my beloved, my
<lb/>Eugenie, my own !—name it !— but alas it is already
<lb/>yielded ere named.”
<lb/>“ You shall conquer then, mon ami," she said, “for the
<lb/>sake of the Eugenie whom you love, this little weakness
<lb/>which you have last confessed—this weakness more moral
<lb/>than physical—and which, let me assure you, is so un-
<lb break="no"/>becoming the nobility of your real nature—so inconsist-
<lb break="no"/>ent with the candor of your usual character—and which,
<lb/>if permitted farther control, will assuredly involve you,
<lb/>sooner or later, in some very disagreeable scrape. You
<lb/>shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation which leads
<lb/>you, as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied
<lb/>denial of your infirmity of vision. For, this infirmity you
<lb/>virtually deny, in refusing to employ the customary means
<lb/>for its relief. You will understand me to say, then, that
<lb/>I wish you to wear spectacles :—ah, hush —you have
<lb/>already consented to wear them, for my sake. You shall
<lb/>accept the little toy which I now hold in my hand, and
<lb/>which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is really of
<lb/>no very immense value as a gem. You perceive that, by
<lb/>a trifling modification thus—or thus—it can be adapted to
<lb/>the eyes in the form of spectacles, or worn in the waist-
<lb break="no"/>coat packet as an eye-glass. It is in the former mode,
<lb/>however, and habitually, that you have already consented
<lb/>to wear it for my sake."
<lb/>This request—must I confess it ?—confused me in no
<lb/>little degree. But the condition with which it was coupled
<lb/>rendered hesitation, of course, a matter altogether out of
<lb/>the question.
<lb/>“It is done !” I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I
<lb/>could muster at the moment. “ It is done—it is most
<lb/>cheerfully agreed. I sacrifise every feeling for your sake.
<pb n="305"/>
<lb/>To-night I wear this dear eye-glass, as an eye-glass and
<lb/>upon my heart ; but with the earliest dawn of that mor-
<lb break="no"/>ning which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife, I
<lb/>will place it upon my—upon my nose—and there wear it
<lb/>ever afterwards, in the less romantic, and less fashionable,
<lb/>but certainly in the more serviceable form which you
<lb/>desire.”
<lb/>Our conversation now turned upon the details of our
<lb/>arrangements for the morrow. Talbot, I learned from my
<lb/>betrothed, had just arrived in town. I was to see him at
<lb/>once, and procure a carriage. The soiree would scarcely
<lb/>break up before two ; and by this hour the vehicle was to
<lb/>be at the door ; when, in the confusion occasioned by the
<lb/>departure of the company, Madame L. could easily enter
<lb/>it unobserved. We were then to call at the house of a
<lb/>clergyman who would be in waiting ; there be married,
<lb/>drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East; leav-
<lb break="no"/>ing the fashionable world at home to make whatever
<lb/>comments upon the matter it thought best.
<lb/>Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and
<lb/>went in search of Talbot, but, on the way, I could, not re-
<lb break="no"/>frain from stepping into a hotel, for the purpose of in-
<lb break="no"/>specting the miniature ; and this I did by the powerful
<lb/>aid of the glasses. The countenance was a surpassingly
<lb/>beautiful one ! Those large luminous eyes !—that proud
<lb/>Grecian nose !—those dark luxuriant curls !—“ Ah !” said
<lb/>I exultingly to myself, “ this is indeed the speaking im-
<lb break="no"/>age of my beloved !” I turned the reverse, and discov-
<lb break="no"/>ered the words—“Eugenie Lalande—aged twenty-seven
<lb/>years and seven months.”
<lb/>I found Talbot at home, and proceeded at once to ac-
<lb break="no"/>quaint nim with my good fortune. He professed exces-
<lb break="no"/>sive astonishment, of course, but congratulated me most
<lb/>cordially, and proffered every assistance in his power. In
<lb/>a word, we carried out our arrangement to the letter ;
<lb/>and, at two in the morning, just ten minutes after the
<lb/>ceremony, I found myself in a close carriage with Ma-
<lb break="no"/>dame Lalande—with Mrs. Simpson, I should say—and
<lb/>driving at a great rate opt of town, in a direction North-
<lb break="no"/>east and by North, half-North.
<lb/>It had been determined, for us by. Talbot, that, as we
<lb/>were to be up all night, we should make our first stop at
<lb/>C-----, a village about twenty miles from the city, and
<lb/>there get an early breakfast and some repose, before pro-
<lb break="no"/>ceeding upon our route. At four precisely, therefore, the
<lb/>carriage drew up at the door of the principal inn. I
<lb/>handed my adored wife out, and ordered breakfast forth-
<lb break="no"/>with. In the mean time we were shown into a small
<lb/>parlor and sate down,
<lb/>It was now nearly if not altogether daylight ; and, as
<lb/>I gazed, enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular
<lb/>idea came, all at once, into my head, that this was really
<lb/>the very first moment since my acquaintance with the
<lb/>celebrated loveliness of Madame Lalande, tha-t I had en-
<lb break="no"/>joyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight,
<lb/>at all.
<lb/>“ And now, mon ami," said she taking my hand, and so
<lb/>interrupting this train of reflection, “ and now, mon cher
<lb/>ami, since we are indissolubly one—since I have yielded
<lb/>to your passionate entreaties, and performed my portion of
<lb/>our agreement—I presume you have not forgotten that you
<lb/>also have a little favor to bestow—a little promise which
<lb/>it is your intention to keep. Ah !-—let me see-! Let me
<lb/>remember ! Yes , full easily do I call to mind the precise
<lb/>words of thee dear promise you made to Eugenie last
<lb/>night. Listen! You spoke thus: “It is done!—it is
<lb/>most cheerfully agreed ! I sacrifise every feeling for your
<lb/>sake. To-night I wear this dear eye-glass as an eye-glass,
<lb/>and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that
<lb/>morning which gives me the privilege of calling you
<lb/>wife, I will place it upon my—upon my nose—and there
<lb/>wear it, ever afterwards, in the less romantic, and less
<lb/>fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable form
<lb/>which you desire.’ These were the exact words, my be-
<lb break="no"/>loved husband, were they not?”
<lb/>“ They were,” I said ; “ you have an excellent memory;
<lb/>and assuredly, my beautiful Eugenie, there is no disposi-
<lb break="no"/>tion on my part to evade the performance of the trivial
<lb/>promise they imply. See ! Behold ! They are becoming—
<lb/>rather—are they not ?” And here, having arranged the
<lb/>glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles, I applied them
<lb/>gingerly in their proper position; while Madame Simp-
<lb break="no"/>son, adjusting her cap, and folding her arms, sat bolt up-
<lb break="no"/>right in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim, and in-
<lb break="no"/>deed in a somewhat undignified position.
<lb/>“Goodness gracious me !” I exclaimed almost at the
<lb/>very, instant that the rim of the spectacles had settled
<lb/>upon my nose—“My! goodness gracious me!—why
<lb/>what can be the matter with these glasses ?” and taking
<lb/>them quickly off, I wiped them carefully with a silk
<lb/>handkerchief, and adjusted them again.
<lb/>But if, in the first instance, there had occurred some-
<lb break="no"/>thing which occasioned me surprise, in the second, this
<lb/>surprise became elevated into astonishment; and this as-
<lb break="no"/>tonishment was profound—was extreme—indeed I may-
<lb break="no"/>say it was horrific. What, in the name of everything
<lb/>hideous, did this mean ? Could I believe my eyes ?—
<lb/>could I ?—that was the question. Was that—was that—
<lb/>was that rouge? And were those—were those—Were
<lb/>those wrinkles, upon the visage of Eugenie Lalande ?—
<lb/>And, oh, Jupiter ! and every one of the gods and goddes-
<lb break="no"/>ses, little and big !—what—what—what—what had be-
<lb break="no"/>come of her teeth ? I dashed the spectacles violently to
<lb/>the ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood erect in the
<lb/>middle of the floor, confronting Mrs. Simpson, with my
<lb/>arms set a-kimbo, and grinning and foaming, but, at the
<lb/>same time utterly speechless and helpless with terror and
<lb/>with rage.
<lb/>Now I have already said that Madame Eugenie La-
<lb break="no"/>lande—that is to say, Simpson—spoke the English lan-
<lb break="no"/>guage but very little better than she wrote it: and for
<lb/>this reason she very properly never attempted to speak it
<lb/>upon ordinary occasions. But rage will carry a lady to
<lb/>any extreme ; and in the present case it carried Mrs.
<lb/>Simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting
<lb/>to hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not alto-
<lb break="no"/>gether understand.
<lb/>“Veil, Monsieur," said she, after surveying me, in
<lb/>great apparent astonishment, for some moments—“ Veil,
<lb/>Monsieur!—and vat den ?—vat de matter now ? Is it de
<lb/>dance of de Saint Vitusse dat you ave ? If not like me,
<lb/>vat for vy buy de pig in de poke ?”
<lb/>“You wretch!” said I, catching my breath—“ you—
<lb/>you—you villainous old hag!”
<lb/>“Ag?—ole?—me not so ver ole, after all! me not one
<lb/>single day more dan de eighty-doo.”
<lb/>“ Eighty-two !” I ejaculated, staggering to the wall—
<lb/>“eighty-two hundred thousand baboons! The minia-
<lb break="no"/>ture said twenty-seven years and seven months!”
<lb/>“To be sure!—dat is so!—ver true ! but den de por-
<lb break="no"/>trait has been take for dese fifty-five year. Ven I go
<lb/>marry my segonde usbande, Monsieur Lalande, at dat time
<lb/>I had de portraite take for my daughter by my first us-
<lb break="no"/>bande, Monsieur Moissart.”
<pb  n="306"/>
<lb/>“Moissart!” said I.
<lb/>“ Yes, Moissart, Moissart;” said she, mimicking my pro-
<lb break="no"/>nunciation, which, to speak the truth, was none of the
<lb/>best; “ and vat den ? Vat you know bout de Moissart ?”
<lb/>“Nothing, you old fright!—I know nothing about him
<lb/>at all only I had an ancestor of that name, once upon a
<lb/>time.”
<lb/>“Dat name! and vat you ave for say to dat name ?—
<lb/>’T is ver goot name ; and so is Voissart—dat is ver goot
<lb/>name, too. My daughter, Madamoiselle Moissart, she
<lb/>marry von Monsieur Voissart; and de name is bote ver
<lb/>respectaable name.”
<lb/>“Moissart!” I exclaimed, “ and Voissart! why what is
<lb/>it you mean ?”
<lb/>“ Vat I mean ?—I mean Moissart and Voissart; and for
<lb/>de matter of dat, I mean Croissart and Froissart, too, if I
<lb/>only tink proper to mean it. My daughter’s daughter,
<lb/>Madamoiselle Voissart, she marry von Monsieur Crois-
<lb break="no"/>sart, and, den agin, my daughter’s grande daughter, Ma-
<lb break="no"/>demoiselle Croissart, she marry von Monsieur Froissart;
<lb/>and I suppose you say dat dat is not von ver respecta-
<lb break="no"/>able name.”
<lb/>“ Froissart!” said I, beginning to faint, “ why surely
<lb/>you don’t say Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and
<lb/>Froissart ?”
<lb/>“ Yes,” she replied, leaning fully back in her chair,
<lb/>and stretching out her lower limbs at great length ; “ yes,
<lb/>Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart. But
<lb/>Monsieur Froissart, he was von ver big vat you call fool—
<lb/>he vas von ver great big donee like yourself—for he lef
<lb/>la belle France for come to dis stupide Amerique—and
<lb/>ven he get here he vent and ave von ver stupide, von ver,
<lb/>ver stupide sonn, so I hear, dough I not yet av ad de plai-
<lb break="no"/>sir to meet vid him—neither me nor my companion, de
<lb/>Madame Stephanie Lalande. He is name de Napoleon
<lb/>Bonaparte Froissart, and I suppose you say dat dat, too,
<lb/>is not von ver respectaable name.”
<lb/>Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the
<lb/>effect of working up Mrs. Simpson into a very extraordi-
<lb break="no"/>nary passion indeed; and as she made an end of it, with
<lb/>great labor, she jumped up from her chair like somebody
<lb/>bewitched, dropping upon the floor an entire universe of
<lb/>bustle as she jumped. Once upon her feet, she gnashed
<lb/>her gums, brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves,
<lb/>shook her fist in my face, and concluded the performance
<lb/>by tearing the cap from her head, and with it an im-
<lb break="no"/>mense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair,
<lb/>the whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a
<lb/>yell, and there trampled and danced a fandango upon it,
<lb/>in an absolute ecstasy and agony of rage.
<lb/>Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had
<lb/>vacated. “ Moissart and Voissart !” I repeated, thought-
<lb break="no"/>fully, as she cut one of her pigeon-wings, and “ Croissart
<lb/>and Froissart!” as she completed another—“Moissart
<lb/>and Voissart and Croissart and Napoleon Bonaparte Frois-
<lb break="no"/>sart !—why, you ineffable old serpent, that’s me—that’s
<lb/>me—d’ye hear ?—that's me"—here I screamed at the top
<lb/>of my voice—“ that's me e e ! I am Napoleon Bonaparte
<lb/>Froissart! and if I hav n’t married my great, great,
<lb/>grandmother, I wish I may be everlastingly confounded !”
<lb/>Madame Eugenie Lalande, quasi Simpson—formerly
<lb/>Moissart—was, in sober fact, my great, great, grandmo-
<lb break="no"/>ther. In her youth she had been beautiful, and even at
<lb/>eighty-two, retained the majestic height, the sculptural
<lb/>contour of head, the fine eyes and the Grecian nose of her
<lb/>girlhood. By the aid of these, of pearl-powder, of rouge,
<lb/>of false hair, false teeth, and false tournure, as well as
<lb/>of the most skilful modistes of Paris, she contrived to
<lb/>hold a respectable footing among the beauties un peu pas-
<lb break="no"/>sées of the French metropolis. In this respect, indeed,
<lb/>she might have been regarded as little less than the equal
<lb/>of the celebrated Ninon De L’Enclos.
<lb/>She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the se-
<lb break="no"/>cond time, a widow without children, she bethought her-
<lb break="no"/>self of my existence in America, and, for the purpose of
<lb/>making me her heir, paid a visit to the United States, in
<lb/>company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative
<lb/>of her second husband’s—a Madame Stephanie Lalande.
<lb/>At the opera, my great, great, grandmother’s attention
<lb/>was arrested by my notice; and, upon surveying me
<lb/>through her eye-glass, she was struck with a certain
<lb/>family resemblance to herself. Thus interested, and
<lb/>knowing that the heir she sought was actually in the
<lb/>city, she made inquiries of her party respecting me.—
<lb/>The gentleman who attended her knew my person, and
<lb/>told her who I was. The information thus obtained in-
<lb break="no"/>duced her to renew her scrutiny ; and this scrutiny it was
<lb/>which so emboldened me that I behaved in the absurd
<lb/>manner already detailed. She returned my bow, howev-
<lb break="no"/>er, under the impression that, by some odd accident, I
<lb/>had discovered her identity. When, deceived by my
<lb/>weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect
<lb/>to the age and charms of the strange lady, I demanded
<lb/>so enthusiastically of Talbot who she was, he concluded
<lb/>that I meant the younger beauty, as a matter of course,
<lb/>and so informed me, with perfect truth, that she was
<lb/>“ the celebrated widow, Madame Lalande.”
<lb/>In the street next morning, my great, great, grandmo-
<lb break="no"/>ther encountered Talbot, an old Parisian acquaintance;
<lb/>and the conversation, very naturally, turned upon myself.
<lb/>My deficiencies of vision were then explained ; for these
<lb/>were notorious, although I was entirely ignorant of their
<lb/>notoriety ; and my good old relative discovered, much to
<lb/>her chagrin, that she had been deceived in supposing me
<lb/>aware of her identity, and that I had been merely making
<lb/>a fool of myself, in making open love, in a theatre, to an
<lb/>old woman unknown. By way of punishing me for this
<lb/>imprudence, she concocted with Talbot a plot. He pur-
<lb break="no"/>posely kept out of my way, to avoid giving me the intro-
<lb break="no"/>duction. My street inquiries about “ the lovely widow,
<lb/>Madame Lalande,” were supposed to refer to the young-
<lb break="no"/>er lady, of course; and thus the conversation with the
<lb/>three gentlemen whom I encountered shortly after leav-
<lb break="no"/>ing Talbot’s hotel, will be easily explained, as also their
<lb/>allusion to Ninon De L’Enclos. I had no opportunity of
<lb/>seeing Madame Lalande closely during daylight; and, at
<lb/>her musical soiree, my silly weakness in refusing the aid
<lb/>of glasses, effectually prevented me from making a dis-
<lb break="no"/>covery of her age. When “ Madame Lalande” was cal-
<lb break="no"/>led upon to sing, the younger lady was intended ; and it
<lb/>was she who arose to obey the call; my great, great,
<lb/>grandmother, to further the deception, arising at the
<lb/>same moment, and accompanying her to the piano in the
<lb/>main drawing-room. Had I decided upon escorting her
<lb/>thither, it had been her design to suggest the propriety
<lb/>of my remaining where I was ; but my own prudential
<lb/>views rendered this unnecessary. The songs which I so
<lb/>much admired, and which so confirmed my impression of
<lb/>the youth of my mistress, were executed by Madame
<lb/>Stephanie Lalande. The eye-glass was presented by
<lb/>way of adding a reproof to the hoax—a sting to the epi-
<lb break="no"/>gram of the deception. Its presentation afforded an op-
<lb break="no"/>portunity for the lecture upon affectation with which I
<lb/>was so especially edified. It is almost superfluous to add
<pb n="307"/>
<lb/>that the glasses of the instrument, as worn by the old
<lb/>lady, had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapt-
<lb break="no"/>ed to my years. They suited me, in fact to a t.
<lb/>The clergyman who merely pretended to tie the fatal
<lb/>knot, was a boon companion of Talbot’s, and no priest.—
<lb/>He was an excellent “whip,” however ; and having dof-
<lb break="no"/>fed his cassock to put on a great coat, he drove the hack
<lb/>which conveyed the “ happy couple” out of town. Tal-
<lb break="no"/>bot took a seat at his side. The two scoundrels were
<lb/>thus “ in at the death,” and, through a half open window
<lb/>of the back parlor of the inn, amused themselves in grin-
<lb break="no"/>ning at the denouement of the drama. I believe I shall
<lb/>be forced to call them both out.
<lb/>Nevertheless, I am not the husband of my great, great,
<lb/>grandmother ; and this is a reflection which affords me
<lb/>infinite relief but I am the husband of Madame La-
<lb break="no"/>lande—of Madame Stephanie Lalande—with whom my
<lb/>good old relative, besides making me her sole heir when
<lb/>she dies—if she ever does—has been at the trouble of
<lb/>concocting me a match. In conclusion: I am done for-
<lb break="no"/>ever with billets doux, and am never to be met without
<lb/>SPECTACLES.	Edgar A. Poe.
<lb/>To ---------
<lb break="no"/>Oh! they never can know that heart of thine,
<lb/>Who dare accuse thee of flirtation!
<lb/>They might as well say that the stars, which shine
<lb/>In the light of their joy o’er Creation,—
<lb/>Are flirting with every wild wave in which lies
<lb/>One beam of the glory that kindles the skies.
<lb/>Smile on then undimmed in your beauty and grace!
<lb/>Too well e’er to doubt, love, we know you;—
<lb/>And shed, from your heaven, the light of your face,
<lb/>Where the waves chase each other below you;
<lb/>For none can e’er deem it your shame or your sin,
<lb/>That each wave holds your star-image smiling within.

<lb/>Critical Notices.
<lb/>We have again to apologise to our publishing friends
<lb/>for the brevity of our Critical Notices. In our next num-
<lb break="no"/>ber we shall devote more than usual attention to this De-

<lb/>Gift-Books—very especially of “ The Missionary Memo-
<lb break="no"/>rial,” “ The Diadem,” “ The Rose,” and “ The Mayflow-

<lb/>an opportunity of judging. For the present (owing to the
<lb/>bustle consequent upon removing our office) we must con-
<lb break="no"/>tent ourselves with a mere announcement of the books
<lb/>on hand for notice.

<lb/>First Love.
<lb/>Oh! precious is the flow’r that Passion brings
<lb/>To his first shrine of beauty, when the heart
<lb/>Runs over in devotion, and no art
<lb/>Checks the free gush of the wild lay he sings;—
<lb/>But the rapt eye, and the impetuous thought
<lb/>Declare the pure affection; and a speech,
<lb/>Such as the ever-timed affections teach,
<lb/>Delivers love’s best confidence unbought;—
<lb/>And all is glory in the o’er-arching sky,
<lb/>And all is beauty in the uplifting earth,
<lb/>And from the wood, and o’er the wave, a mirth,
<lb/>Such as mocks hope with immortality,
<lb/>Declares that all the loved ones are at hand,
<lb/>With still the turtle’s voice the loudest in the land.
<lb/>W. Gilmore Simms.

<lb/>Musical Department.
<lb/>Mrs. V. Mott's Concert.—One of the most fashionable
<lb/>audiences we ever witnessed, crowded the Apollo Saloon
<lb/>that evening. The fair debutante was received with loud
<lb/>cheers whenever she made her appearance. Thou art
<lb/>lovelier, and the Wanderer, were the gems of the per-
<lb break="no"/>formance. Indeed, no other piece, than the latter, could
<lb/>haves shown the beautiful contralto of Mrs. Mott. We
<lb/>were not so much pleased with the first of her pieces.—
<lb/>Here and there it is said, but only in a whisper—it was a
<lb/>failure. We do not think so. Laboring under many dis-
<lb break="no"/>advantages, Mrs. Mott acquitted herself even better than
<lb/>we thought she would. She will sing again at the Phil-
<lb break="no"/>harmonic Concert. To speak of the other part of the per-
<lb break="no"/>formance : Mr. P. Mayer is becoming quite a favorite —
<lb/>He sang the Exile, a German composition, most beauti-
<lb break="no"/>fully, and his rich baritone voice was never displayed to
<lb/>better advantage. Messrs. Kyle and Timm played the
<lb/>duett for Flute and Piano exquisitely ; Mr. K„ particular-
<lb break="no"/>ly, was better than on any other occasion. The duett of
<lb/>Messrs. Loder and Timm, however well played, did not
<lb/>please much. A like fate had the first concerted piece.
<lb/>But altogether, we. think a repetition of the Concert in
<lb/>the Tabernacle, would not be amiss.
<lb/>Mr. Leopold De Meyer, the Lion-pianist; as they will
<lb/>have it, had a crowded house on the night of his second
<lb/>concert. He was encored several times. It seems, that
<lb/>of all the pianists in this city, Mr. Perabeau alone can
<lb/>muster courage enough to wrestle with him for the
<lb/>wreath of laurels. But we have mentioned already, that
<lb/>whatever gestures he makes, in whatever position, he
<lb/>forces himself, or however he thumps on the piano, he
<lb/>can never make the public believe that he is as great as
<lb/>De Meyer; though he has this advantage, that whenever
<lb/>Dantan wishes to make a caricature of the great pianist,
<lb/>Perabeau, he need not trouble himself to invent one.
<lb/>Miss Northall did not sing as well as usual, owing,
<lb/>perhaps, to the hasty travelling from Philadelphia, where
<lb/>she sang but the night before,'to this city. Madame La-
<lb break="no"/>zare and Mr. Mayer acquitted themselves well. . De
<lb/>Meyer is now in Boston, but no accounts of his triumph,
<lb/>for such we expect, certainly, have reached us as yet.
<lb/>The Oratorio of Sampson will be performed under the
<lb/>direction of Mr. LL C. Hill, at the Tabernacle. We
<lb/>think, that, substituting another for this, would do us no
<lb/>harm; however, we have no doubt it will be well per-
<lb break="no"/>formed. Mr. Paige will make his first appearance as a
<lb/>public singer, so the papers say. We wonder that the
<lb/>New-York Sacred Music Society employs Boston artists
<lb/>for the different solo parts ? Is there any want of good
<lb/>vocalists here ?
<lb/>Paulus, Mendelsjohn Barsholdy’s chef d’oeuvre, is in
<lb/>preparation; and will be brought out soon, with Mr. Geo.
<lb/>Loder as conductor.
<lb/>A German Opera Troupe will occupy Palmo’s Thea-
<lb break="no"/>tre for a season. Per Freicthutz, with Madame Otto as
<lb/>Prima Donna, will be brought out. Then we are to have
<lb/>the Magic Flute, Don Juan, Czaar and Zimmerman, to-
<lb break="no"/>gether with the best Italian Operas with German text.—
<lb/>Mr. P. Mayer and Meyer, also Miss Windmuller will
<lb/>form part of the troupe. How far. is will succeed, we
<lb/>know not, but we wish them success from the bottom of
<lb/>our heart.
<lb/>The following publications have been sent us by either
<lb/>publisher or composer:
<lb/>“Poor Tom,” composed by George P. Manouvrier, and
<lb/>published by John F. Nunns, 240 Broadway.
<lb/>Phillips’ Quick Step.
<lb/>L’Alliance, Brilliant Waltz; and
<lb/>Echo Song, the words by Mrs. Frances S. Osgood.—All
<lb/>of them composed by Mr. Saroni, and. published by Geo.
<lb/>Willig, Philadelphia.
<lb/>“It is the Chime,’’ composed by Benjamin S. Hart,
<lb/>and published by Atwill.
<lb/>“Kind Friends we Meet Again,” words selected and
<lb/>melody composed by Henry Stone, and respectfully dedi-
<lb break="no"/>cated to his friend, E. Thompson, Esq., of Michigan. Ar-
<lb break="no"/>ranged for the Piano-forte by H. A. Osborne. Published
<lb/>by Ampler.
<lb/>‘‘Poor Tom," is a beautiful composition, most admi-
<lb break="no"/>rably got up by Mr. Nunns ; and the name of Saroni will
<lb/>be a guarantee for the other three. But it is of the two
<lb/>latter that we wish to speak more particularly. We
<lb/>have perused them again and again, and have found
<lb/>nothing worth noticing save the titles : the one for its
<lb/>miserable lithography, the other for its length. The
<lb/>composers of both are amateurs.
<lb/>The amateurs’ object of publishing compositions is like
<lb/>that of a great many brothers of the profession—to satis-
<lb break="no"/>fy a little vanity—to be thought a genius and prodigy by
<lb/>the uninitiated, and to be thought a fool by the knowing
<lb/>ones. If it would serve at all to advance the cause of
<lb/>music, not a word would we have to say ; but it is just
<lb/>the very thing which corrupts musical taste. Publishers
<lb/>who are secured from loss, by sufficient exchange with
<lb/>other publishers, print anything they can get hold of, pro-
<lb break="no"/>vided no remuneration, save a few copies, of the piece, is
<lb/>asked for it. People will have new music, and not find-
<lb break="no"/>ing anything good, they get indifferent at last, and take
<lb/>whatever the publisher recommends them, as long as a
<lb/>showy title adorns the composition. No wonder that
<lb/>musicians do not publish their pieces here, when they
<lb/>can get, at least, a fair price for them at other places, and
<lb/>have no competition with badly lithographed titles and
<lb/>and yard-long dedications. Messrs. Hart and Stone’s
<lb/>pieces are no better nor worse than hundreds of others ;
<lb/>and we are almost sorry that they should be the ones we
<lb/>have to vent our spleen at. But let it be a good lesson to
<lb/>all amateur composers. We shall not spare them as long
<lb/>as we are able to hold a pen, or as long as they do not re-
<lb break="no"/>form, and study the rules of composition and thorough-
<lb break="no"/>bass, before publishing anything.
<lb/>The Drama.
<lb/>Reports from all parts of the country show a most pros-
<lb break="no"/>perous condition of affairs throughout the American thea-
<lb break="no"/>trical world.
<lb/>In every place, where attraction is even expected,
<lb/>houses are crowded ; and new candidates for popular fa-
<lb break="no"/>vor are constantly pressing forward. During the past
<lb/>week the question of the merit and praiseworthiness of
<lb/>various foreign performers, has come up in different quar-
<lb break="no"/>ters.
<lb/>In the opinion of a portion of the press, a regular de-
<lb break="no"/>ception is practised on the pockets of the public, by art-
<lb break="no"/>ists from the old world past their prime or who have
<lb/>never attained a prime, from sheer want of faculty. On
<lb/>the other hand a claim to supernatural gifts in musical
<lb/>and dramatic execution, is claimed by partizans equally
<lb/>violent. On all these points we have our own opinion,
<lb/>which we shall take occasion to spread at length before
<lb/>our readers, hereafter. Among those who have been sub-
<lb break="no"/>ject of discussion, we find named Mr. Leopold De Meyer
<pb n="309"/>
<lb/>pianist, Mr. Ole Bull, violinist, Mr. Charles Kean, tra-
<lb break="no"/>gedian, Mr. Templeton, vocalist. The Sequins also at
<lb/>Philadelphia, and the Delcy company, have participated
<lb/>in these doubts. These things arc ominous, and when we
<lb/>come to consider them, we shall do so without unfair na-
<lb break="no"/>tional bias, and with reference only to the general stand-
<lb break="no"/>ards of art and merit. Among the incidents of the past
<lb/>week, one of the most striking has been the presentation
<lb/>to Mr. Murdoch at Philadelphia, of an elegant copy of
<lb/>Shakspeare. It occurred on Friday evening, the night
<lb/>of his benefit, before a most brilliant audience, after his
<lb/>performance of Hamlet.
<lb/>We present the speeches, which embody the purpose
<lb/>and sentiment of the occasion.
<lb/>Col. Page, in presenting the volume to Mr. Murdoch,
<lb/>said:—
<lb/>Mr. Murdoch ,—At the request of numerous friends and some of
<lb/>your schoolmates, I am here to-night in the discharge of a pleasing
<lb/>duty—that of presenting you with a testimonial of the regard they
<lb/>feel for you as a man, and the favorable opinion which they enter-
<lb break="no"/>tain of your abilities as an Actor.
<lb/>It comes in the shape of this superbly bound and approved edition
<lb/>of the works of the Immortal Bard, to whose varied and delightful
<lb/>creations, in your recent round of performances in this city and
<lb/>elsewhere, you have imparted new beauties, and given increased
<lb/>interest.
<lb/>It is intended by this offering, appropriate as I regard it to be, to
<lb/>stimulate you in the highly praiseworthy but arduous task you have
<lb/>undertaken, and show that your townsmen, ready as they have ever
<lb/>been to patronize merit from abroad, (for mind, Heaven's priceless
<lb/>gift to man belongs to no country and is bound by no clime,) can
<lb/>never be indifferent to Native Talent, but will always foster and en-
<lb break="no"/>courage and cheer it onward to a bright and brilliant future.
<lb/>Allow me then to hand you these beautiful volumes, a deserved
<lb/>tribute to personal worth and professional skill. Such a combina-
<lb break="no"/>tion, aided and guided by Industry and Genius, must command suc-
<lb break="no"/>cess; they will win for you the proudest chaplet of Histrionic
<lb/>Fame, and add another name to the already glorious list of the dis-
<lb break="no"/>tinguished sons of the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave.
<lb/>To which, Mr. Murdoch replied :—
<lb/>Co... Page:—In accepting this valuable and beautiful copy of
<lb/>the works of the great master of the human heart, permit me to ex-
<lb break="no"/>press my deep sense of gratitude to the kind donors for the gift, and
<lb/>to yourself for the generous feelings which prompted you in becom-
<lb break="no"/>ing the presenter. We are told, sir, that life is a sandy desert, with
<lb/>but few green spots in it to cheer the weary traveller. The many
<lb/>acts of kindness I have received at the hands of the citizens of Phi-
<lb break="no"/>ladelphia, from my first appearance before them till the present mo-
<lb break="no"/>ment, have truly, however, made my desert smile with continued
<lb/>verdure, and abound with flowers—sweet and lasting.
<lb/>This present is doubly dear to mb—first, as it is the page of truth
<lb/>and nature, and the field in which I labor; and next, as coming
<lb/>from the hands of those who were boys with me, and who now, as
<lb/>men. step forward to cheer on an old co-mate through the rugged
<lb/>paths which lead to public honors. Their deeds of friendship “are
<lb/>registered, where every day I turn the leaf to read them.” May
<lb/>heaven bless them, one and all.
<lb/>And now, ladies and gentlemen, please accept my thanks for
<lb/>your kindness this evening, and during the evenings of the past
<lb/>fortnight. Should I ever grow regardless of the deep debt I owe
<lb/>my native city, the sight of these volumes, and one glance thrown
<lb/>back by memory to this memorable night, and the brilliant array
<lb/>befere me, will suffice to awaken all those feelings of gratitude
<lb/>and affection with which my heart is now eating, and to the ut-
<lb break="no"/>terance of which my tongue struggles in vain for expressions of
<lb/>deep-seated and heart-felt thankfulness.
<lb/>I shall have the pleasure of making .my bow to you, once more,
<lb/>tomorrow night, after which I shall leave you for the present,for
<lb/>other scenes. Most respectfully, Adieu—tendered, on my part,
<lb/>with a full determination to deserve a continuance of your favors.
<lb/>Adieu! Adieu!
<lb/>Editorial Miscellany.
<lb/>We have to apologize for the insufficient variety of the
<lb/>present number. We were not aware of the great length
<lb/>of'“ The Spectacles” until too late to remedy the evil.
<lb/>As we very confidently expected, our friends in the
<lb/>Southern and Western country (true friends, and tried,)
<lb/>are taking up arms in our cause—and more especially in
<lb/>the cause of a national as distinguished from a sectional
<lb/>literature. They cannot see (it appears) any farther ne-
<lb break="no"/>cessity for being ridden to death by New-England. Hear
<lb/>the “Charleston Patriot” :
<lb/>Poe’s Poetry.—Mr. Edgar A. Poe is one of the most remarka-
<lb break="no"/>ble, in many respects, among our men of letters. With singular
<lb/>endowments of imagination, he is at the same time largely pos-
<lb break="no"/>sessed of many of the qualities that go to make an admirable cri-
<lb break="no"/>tic;—he is methodical, lucid, forcible,—well-read, thoughtful, and
<lb/>capable, at all times, of rising from the mere consideration of the
<lb/>individual subject, to the principles, in literature and art, by which
<lb/>it should be governed. Add to these qualities, as a critic, that he
<lb/>is not a person to be overborne and silenced by a reputation;—
<lb/>that mere names do not control his judgment;—that he is bold, in-
<lb break="no"/>dependent, and stubbornly analytical, in the formation of his opin-
<lb break="no"/>ions. He has his defects also;—he is sometimes the victim of ca-
<lb break="no"/>pricious moods;—his temper is variable—his nervous organiza-
<lb break="no"/>tion being such, evidently, as to subject his judgments, sometimes,
<lb/>to influences that may be traced to the weather and the winds.—
<lb/>He takes his colour from the clouds; and his sympathies are not
<lb/>unfrequently chilled and rendered ungenial, by the pressure of the
<lb/>atmosphere—the cold and the vapors of a climate affecting his mo-
<lb break="no"/>ral nature, through his physical, in greater degree than is usual
<lb/>among literary men,—who, by the way, are generally far more
<lb/>susceptible to these influences, than is the case with the multitude.
<lb/>Such are the causes which occasionally operate to impair the value
<lb/>and the consistency of his judgments as a Critic.—As a Poet, Mr.
<lb/>Poe’s imagination becomes remarkably conspicuous, and to sur-
<lb break="no"/>render himself freely to his own moods, would be to make all his
<lb/>writings in verse, efforts of pure imagination only. He seems to
<lb/>dislike the merely practical, and to shrink from the concrete. His
<lb/>fancy takes the ascendant in his Poetry, and wings his thoughts to
<lb/>such superior elevations, as to render it too intensely spiritual for
<lb/>the ordinary reader. With a genius thus endowed and constituted,
<lb/>it was a blunder with Mr. Poe to accept the appointment, which
<lb/>called him to deliver himself in poetry before the Boston Lyceum.
<lb/>Highly imaginative men can scarcely succeed in such exhibitions.
<lb/>The sort of poetry called for on such occasions, is the very reverse
<lb/>of the spiritual, the fanciful or the metaphysical. To win the ears
<lb/>of a mixed audience, nothing more is required than moral or pa-
<lb break="no"/>triotic common places in rhyming heroics. The verses of Pope are
<lb/>just the things for such occasions. You must not pitch your flight
<lb/>higher than the penny-whistle elevation of
<lb/>“ Know then this truth, enough for man to know,
<lb/>Virtue alone is happiness below.’’
<lb/>Either this, or declamatory verse,—or something patriotic, or some,
<lb/>thing satirical, or something comical. At all events, you must
<lb/>not be mystical. You must not task the audience to study. Your
<lb/>song must be such as they can read running, and comprehend
<lb/>while munching pea-nuts. Mr. Poe is not the writer-for this sort
<lb/>of thing. He is too original, too fanciful, too speculative, too any-
<lb break="no"/>thing in verse, for the comprehension of any but audience fit though
<lb/>few' In obeying this call to Boston, Mr. Poe committed another
<lb/>mistake. He had been mercilessly exercising himself as a critic
<lb/>at the expense of some of their favorite writers. The swans of
<lb/>New England, under his delineation, had been described as mere
<lb/>geese, and those, too, of none of the whitest. He had been expos-
<lb break="no"/>ing the short comings and the plagiarisms of Mr. Longfellow,
<lb/>who is supposed, along the banks of the Penobscot, to be about the
<lb/>comliest bird that ever dipped his bill in Pieria. Poe had dealt
<lb/>with the favorites of Boston unsparingly, and they hankered after
<lb/>their revenges. In an evil hour, then, did he consent to commit
<lb/>himself, in verse to their tender mercies. It is positively amusing
<pb  n="310"/>
<lb/>to see how eagerly all the little witlings of the press, in the old
<lb/>purlieus of the Puritan, flourish the cirtical tomahawk about the
<lb/>head of their critic. In their eagerness for retribution, one of the
<lb/>papers before us actually congratulates itself and readers on the
<lb/>(asserted) failure of the poet. The good editor himself was not
<lb/>present, but he hammers away not the less lustily at the
<lb/>victim, because his objections are to be made at second hand.—
<lb/>Mr. Poe committed another error in consenting to address an au-
<lb break="no"/>dience in verse, who, for three mortal hours, had been compelled to
<lb/>sit and hear Mr. Caleb Cushing in prose. The attempt to speak
<lb/>after this, in poetry, and fanciful poetry, too, was sheer madness.
<lb/>The most patient audience in the world, must have been utterly
<lb/>exhausted by the previous infliction. But it is denied that Mr.
<lb/>Poe failed at all. He had been summoned to recite poetry. It is
<lb/>asserted that he did so. The Boston Courier, one of the most
<lb/>thoughtful of the journals of that city, gives us a very favorable
<lb/>opinion of the performance which has been so harshly treated.—
<lb/>'The Poem,” says that journal, “called ‘ The Messenger Star,’
<lb/>was an eloquent and classic production, based on the right princi-
<lb break="no"/>ples, containing the essence of true poetry, mingled with a gorgeous
<lb/>imagination, exquisite painting, every charm of metre, and a
<lb/>graceful delivery. It strongly reminded us of Mr. Horne’s
<lb/>‘Orion,’ and resembled it in the majesty of its design, the noble-
<lb break="no"/>ness of its incidents, and its freedom from the trammels of produc-
<lb break="no"/>tions usual on these occasions. The delicious word-painting of
<lb/>some of its scenes brought vividly to our recollection, Keats’
<lb/>' Eve of St. Agnes,’ and parts of ‘ Paradise Lost.’
<lb/>That it was malapropos to the occasion, we take the liberty to
<lb/>deny. What is the use of repeating the ‘ mumbling farce’ of
<lb/>having invited a poet to deliver a poem We (too often) find a
<lb/>person get up and repeat a hundred or two indifferent couplets of
<lb/>words, with jingling rhymes and stale witticisms, with scarcely a
<lb/>line of poetry in the whole, and which will admit of no superlative
<lb/>to describe it. If we are to have a poem, why not have the ‘ true
<lb/>thing,’ that will be recognize! as such,—for poems being written
<lb/>for people that can appreciate them, it would be as well to cater
<lb/>lor their tastes as for individuals who cannot distinguish between
<lb/>the true and the false.”
<lb/>The good sense of this extract should do much towards enforc-
<lb break="no"/>ing the opinion which it conveys; and it confirms our own, pre-
<lb break="no"/>viously entertained and expressed, in regard to the affair in ques-
<lb break="no"/>tion. Mr. Poe’s error was not, perhaps, in making verses, nor
<lb/>making them after a fashion of his own; but in delivering them
<lb/>before an audience of mixed elements, and just after a discourse
<lb/>of three mortal hours by a prosing orator. That any of his hear-
<lb break="no"/>ers should have survived the two-fold infliction, is one of those in-
<lb break="no"/>stances of good fortune which should bring every person present
<lb/>to his kness in profound acknowledgement to a protecting provi-
<lb break="no"/>dence.
<lb/>We thank our friend of "The Patriot” and agree with
<lb/>him fully, of course, in all points except his disparage-
<lb break="no"/>ment of Mr. Cushing, who read us a very admirable dis-
<lb break="no"/>course. “ The Patriot,” it will be understood, has not
<lb/>yet seen our reply of week before last.
<lb/>Were the question demanded of us—‘‘What is the
<lb/>most exquisite of sublunary pleasures ?” we should reply,
<lb/>without hesitation, the making a fuss, or, in the classical
<lb/>words of a western friend, the “ kicking up a bobbery.”
<lb/>Never was a “bobbery” more delightful than that
<lb/>which we have just succeeded in “ kicking up” all around
<lb/>about Boston Common. We never saw the Frog-Pond-
<lb break="no"/>ians so lively in our lives. They seem absolutely to be
<lb/>upon the point of waking up. In about nine days the
<lb/>puppies may get open their eyes.
<lb/>That is to say they may get open their eyes to certain
<lb/>facts which have long been obvious to all the world ex-
<lb break="no"/>cept themselves—the facts that there exist other cities
<lb/>than Boston—other men of letters than Professor Long-
<lb break="no"/>fellow—other vehicles of literary information than the
<lb/>“ Down-East Review.”
<lb/>As regards our late poem.—Hear the “St, Louis Re-
<lb break="no"/>veille.”
<lb/>“ The Broadway Journal is edited and owned solely by Mr. Ed-
<lb break="no"/>gar A. Poe. If he had as much tact as talent, he would make suc-
<lb break="no"/>cess for half a dozen papers.”
<lb/>So says an exchange paper. Poe, reliant upon his talent, has
<lb/>too much contempt for tact; he is wrong, but his error makes his
<lb/>career the more remarkable. He is full of eccentricity. Does he
<lb/>mean, by the following, that his late Boston Poem, was intended by
<lb/>him as a hoax ?
<lb/>“We have been quizzing the Bostonians, and one or two of the
<lb/>more stupid of their editors and editresses have taken it in high dud-
<lb break="no"/>geon. We will attend to them all in good time.”
<lb/>To our friend Field we thus reply: We had tact
<lb/>enough not to be “ taken in and done for” by the Bostoni-
<lb break="no"/>ans. Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes—(for timeo sub-
<lb break="no"/>stitute contemno or turn-up-our-nose-o). We knew very
<lb/>well that, among a certain clique of the Frogpondians,
<lb/>there existed a predetermination to abuse us under any
<lb/>circumstances. We knew that, write what we would,
<lb/>they would swear it to be worthless. We knew that
<lb/>were we to compose for them a “ Paradise Lost,” they
<lb/>would pronounce it an indifferent poem. It would have
<lb/>been very weak in us, then, to put ourselves to the trou-
<lb break="no"/>ble of attempting to please these people. We preferred
<lb/>pleasing ourselves. We read before them a “juvenile”
<lb/>—a very “juvenile” poem—and thus the Frogpondians
<lb/>were had—were delivered up to the enemy bound hand
<lb/>and foot. Never were a set of people more completely
<lb/>demolished. They have blustered and flustered—but
<lb/>what have they done or said that has not made them
<lb/>more thoroughly ridiculous?—what, in the name of Mo-
<lb break="no"/>mus, is it possible for them to do or to say ?
<lb/>We “ delivered” them the “juvenile poem” and they
<lb/>received it with applause. This is accounted for by the
<lb/>fact that the clique (contemptible in numbers as in every
<lb/>thing else) were overruled by the rest of the assembly.
<lb/>These malignants did not dare to interrupt by their pre-
<lb break="no"/>concerted hisses, the respectful and profound attention of
<lb/>the majority. We have been told, indeed, that as many
<lb/>as three or four of the personal friends of the little old
<lb/>lady entitled Miss Walters, did actually leave the hall
<lb/>during the recitation—but, upon the whole, this was the
<lb/>very best thing they could do. We have been told this,
<lb/>we say—we did not see them take their departure :—the
<lb/>fact is they belong to a class of people that we make it a
<lb/>point never to see.
<lb/>The poem being thus well received, in spite of this
<lb/>ridiculous little cabal—the next thing to be done was to
<lb/>abuse it in the papers. Here, they imagined, they were
<lb/>sure of their game. But what have they accomplished ?
<lb/>The poem, they say, is bad. We admit it. We insisted
<lb/>upon this fact in our prefatory remarks, and we insist
<lb/>upon it now, over and over again. It is bad—it is wre'ch-
<lb break="no"/>ed—and what then ? We wrote it at ten years of age'—
<lb/>had it been worth even a pumpkin-pie undoubtedly we
<lb/>should not have “delivered” it to them.
<lb/>To demonstrate its utter worthlessness, “The Boston
<lb/>Star” (a journal which, we presume, is to be considered
<lb/>as a fair representative of the Frogpondian genius) has
<lb/>copied the poem in full, with two or three columns of
<lb/>criticism (we suppose) by way of explaining that we
<lb/>should have been hanged for its perpetration. There is
<lb/>no doubt of it whatever—we should. “ The Star,” how-
<lb break="no"/>ever, (a dull luminary) has done us more honor than it
<lb/>intended ; it has copied our third edition of the poem,
<lb/>revised and improved. We considered this too good for
<lb/>the occasion by one half, and so “ delivered” the first
<lb/>edition with all its imperfections on its head. It is the
<lb/>first—the original edition—the delivered edition—which
<lb/>we now republish in our collection of Poems.
<pb n="311"/>
<lb/>Repelled at these points, the Frogpondian faction hire a
<lb/>thing they call the “ Washingtonian Reformer” (or some-
<lb break="no"/>thing of that kind) to insinuate that we must have been
<lb/>“intoxicated” to have become possessed of sufficient au-
<lb break="no"/>dacity to “ deliver” such a poem to the Frogpondians.
<lb/>In the first place, why cannot these miserable hypo-
<lb break="no"/>crites say “ drunk” at once and be done with it ? In the
<lb/>second place we are perfectly willing to admit that we
<lb/>were drunk—in the face of at least eleven or twelve hun-
<lb break="no"/>dred Frogpondians who will be willing to take oath that
<lb/>we were not. We are willing to admit either that we
<lb/>were drunk, or that we set fire to the Frog-pond, or that
<lb/>once upon a time we cut the throat of our grandmother.
<lb/>The fact is we are perfectly ready to admit any thing at
<lb/>all—but what has cutting the throat of our grandmother
<lb/>to do with our poem, or the Frogpondian stupidity?
<lb/>We shall get drunk when we please. As for the
<lb/>editor of the “Jeffersonian Teetotaler” (or whatever
<lb/>it is) we advise her to get drunk, too, as soon as possi-
<lb break="no"/>ble—for when sober she is a disgrace to the sex—on ac-
<lb break="no"/>count of being so awfully stupid.
<lb/>N. B. The “ Washingtonian Teetotaler” is edited by a
<lb/>little old lady in a mob-cap and spectacles—at least, we
<lb/>presume so, for every second paper in Boston is.
<lb/>P. S. Miss Walters (the Syren!) has seen cause, we
<lb/>find, to recant all the ill-natured little insinuations she
<lb/>has been making against us (mere white lies—she
<lb/>need not take them so much to heart) and is now over-
<lb break="no"/>whelming us with apologies—things which we have
<lb/>never yet been able to withstand. She defends our poem
<lb/>on the ground of its being “juvenile,” and we think the
<lb/>more of her defence because she herself has been juvenile
<lb/>so long as to be a judge of juvenility. Well, upon the
<lb/>whole we must forgive her—and do. Say no more about
<lb/>it, you little darling ! You are a delightful creature and
<lb/>your heart is in the right place—would to Heaven that
<lb/>we could always say the same thing of your wig !
<lb/>In conclusion:—The Frogpondians may as well spare
<lb/>us their abuse. If we cared a fig for their wrath we
<lb/>should not first have insulted them to their teeth, and
<lb/>then subjected to their tender mercies a volume of our
<lb/>Poems:—that, we think, is sufficiently clear. The fact is,
<lb/>we despise them and defy them (the transcendental vaga-
<lb break="no"/>bonds !) and they may all go to the devil together.

<lb/>“This work has created a prodigious excitement throughout
<lb/>England: it is unique in its character, as a literary production. It
<lb/>seems to partake of the features of an autobiography; the narrative
<lb/>being full of personal detail, description of the perilous adventure
<lb/>and imminent hazard of the author, in his expedition through the
<lb/>East. No man living, perhaps, has travelled so extensively as this
<lb/>celebrated individual, and few could have contributed a more in
<lb/>tensely interesting narrative of his experience.
<lb/>“It will thus be seen that this extraordinary and eccentric man
<lb/>is admirably qualified to present a transcript of Asiatic Character-
<lb break="no"/>istics,—supplying much that is novel and exceedingly curious
<lb/>about tribes and nations of which we know so little. To say that
<lb/>the work is an acceptable addition to the library of travel, is affirm-
<lb break="no"/>ing lar too little of so striking a production: it is a book that ought
<lb/>to be read and deliberately enjoyed by every intelligent person, for
<lb/>its quaintness, freshness, and superabounding interest. The work
<lb/>is elegantly printed as a library book, and adorned by some dozen
<lb/>curious fac-similes of oriental drawings.”—Courier and Enquirer.

<lb/>DENTISTRY.
<lb/>DOCT. H. E. SCHOONMAKER, Dental Surgeon, Office 446
<lb/>Houston St., two doors from Broadway—opposite St. Thomas’
<lb/>Church.
<lb/>Doct. S’s experience and skill in his profession, give him con-
<lb break="no"/>fidence in asserting that his operations are unsurpassed by any
<lb/>Dentist in this city. Dr. S.’s manner of inserting artificial teeth
<lb/>varies in many essential points from the usual mode ; and his suc-
<lb break="no"/>cess in pleasing all, he is happy to say, has brought him many
<lb/>difficult cases, which had been unsuccessfully treated by Dentists
<lb/>of established professional reputation, and whose prices for the
<lb/>same operation were double his own. The object in inserting
<lb/>artificial teeth is to supply the deficiency occasioned by the loss of
<lb/>natural teeth, both in regard to utility, comfort in wearing, and
<lb/>natural appearance. In all these points, Doct S.’s manner is pre-
<lb break="no"/>eminent. His mechanical tact and ingenuity have enabled him to
<lb/>surmount many obstacles, which have long, with the profession
<lb/>generally, impeded the path to success in every operation. He
<lb/>makes use of the best materials in all his operations—and in cases
<lb/>where the gum has fallen away by absorption, (which is always
<lb/>the case, more or less, when teeth have been extracted,) which
<lb/>causes a contraction of the lips and cheeks, the disfigurement of
<lb/>which cannot be fully obviated without adopting the artificial gums,
<lb/>which will supply the deficiency, and give to the mouth its usual
<lb/>redundancy—besides, their beauty and natural appearance, ren-
<lb break="no"/>der detection impossible.
<lb/>Dr. S. would be happy to refer those who require it, to many of
<lb/>the best families in this City, in which he has practised.
<lb/>Ladies who desire it, can have their teeth examined at their re-
<lb break="no"/>sidences, by sending their address as above.	nov. 8—9t

<lb/>*Caution. —Large quantities of Hyson Skin are retailed in
<lb/>this market as being a Hyson Tea. It is well worth while to com-
<lb break="no"/>pare the Hyson tea usually sold at 75 cents with the genuine arti-
<lb break="no"/>cle that the Company offer at the same price. The difference is so
<lb/>perceptible on trial as to render any further comment unnecessary.
<lb/>Monstrous Fraud.—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be
<lb/>retailed by small dealers,'in this country, at 75 cents per pound,
<lb/>because they frequently cost that money in China, and no Importer
<lb/>in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a less
<lb/>price than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages. T. F.
<lb/>Davies, Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner
<lb/>in which he saw the lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured
<lb/>and colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpow-
<lb break="no"/>der and Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a com-
<lb break="no"/>bination of Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poi-
<lb break="no"/>son. Let purchasers therefore beware of adulterated teas, and
<lb/>deal with those venders whose characters and resources raise them
<lb/>above suspicion. Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas
<lb/>retailed at 75 cents per pound, and compare them with the genuine
<lb/>article sold by the Pekin Tea Company No one, it is presumed,
<lb/>wishes to drink poison. The Company have published a book,
<lb/>giving full details on this subject, which may be had at their
<lb/>Warehouse, 75 Fulton street, free of charge.
<lb/>RECOMMENDATIONS.
<lb/>W3 drink Green Ten, and for many years have been paying one dollar per
<lb/>pound for it. But thinks to the Pekin Tea Company, we now get a better tea
<lb/>from them at 75 cents per pound. We drink one pound per week, by which
<lb/>we are now saving thirteen dollars per year, and enjoying better tea in the
<lb/>bargain. Commend us to the Pekin Tea Company, say we.—Mirror.
<lb/>The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, are performing a great and good
<lb/>work, and will, in a few years, beyond all doubt, drive all the poor teas which
<lb/>have deluged this country, pud defrauded consumers of the article, out of the
<lb/>market. They import none but pure and fragrant teas, and detail them by the
<lb/>single pound at wholesale prices. Families are always sure of obtaining good
<lb/>teas at this great tea warehouse, in quantities to suit their convenience, and at
<lb/>the same price that the merchant pays who buys to sell it gain.—Daily True
<lb/>Sun.
<lb/>You may be sure of obtaining at all times, ppure and highly flavored teas, by
<lb/>the single pound, at wholesale prices, of the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton
<lb/>street.—They have probably the largest stock, and greatest variety of fine
<lb/>green and black teas, of any one establishment in the United States. They
<lb/>are doing a large business, and a great benefit to consumers of tea.—Atlas.
<lb/>Heretofore it has been very difficult, indeed impossible, to always obtain
<lb/>good green and black teas. But now you have only to visit the ware rooms of
<lb/>the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, to obtain as delicious and fragrant
<lb/>teas as you could wish for.—Daily Sun.
<lb/>If any of our readers desire to have good tea, they can obtain it of the Pekin
<lb/>Tea Company, 75 Fulton street.—Mercury.
<lb/>A Word to Tea Drinkers.—The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street,
<lb/>have imported into this market some five hundred thousand dollars worth of
<lb/>the finest grades of Green and Black Teas grown in the Celestial Empire, done
<lb/>up in all the various fancy packages that Chinese ingenuity can invent. It is
<lb/>a privilege to buy teas at this great establishment, and a luxury and comfort
<lb/>to drink them They sell good teas only, and retail them at wholesale prices.
<lb/>Country met chants who wish to always sell good teas can always obtain them
<lb/>at this place, on reasonable terms.—Emporium.
<lb/>The Pekin Tea Company—We very cheerfully call the attention of all
<lb/>lovers of pure and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the great Tea
<lb/>warehouse of this Company. Our long acquaintance with the proprietors en-
<lb break="no"/>ables us to bespeak for them the entire confidence of the public. We know
<lb/>that their Teas, both in quality and price, are all that is stated of them. Many
<lb/>a lover of the fragrant herb has been compelled to eschew the drinking of Tea
<lb/>in consequence of its injurious effects, until at length he has become hopeless
<lb/>of finding, among any of the imported varieties of Tea in our market, a kind
<lb/>which had not such an effect. Xu this, however, such persons will be agree-
<lb break="no"/>ably disappointed. The Pekin Tea Company have commenced the importation
<lb/>of choice varieties of Garden Teas, of most delicious flavor-cultivated and
<lb/>picked with great care, which have heretofore never been introduced into this
<lb/>country, except as presents to importers. Among these they have, an Oolong,
<lb/>mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we especially recommend to all
<lb/>nervous persons. Its effect upon many of those who have tried it, has been
<lb/>to make them confirmed tea-drinkers. Ladies who have used it, say they
<lb/>never before drank such tea. But all testes can here be suited, with the great
<lb/>advantage over other stores of getting a pure article at wholesale price, how-
<lb break="no"/>ever small the quantity. The Company's Warehouse is at 75 Fulton street.—
<lb/>New World.
<lb/>Tea.—The Pekin Tea Company, No 75 Fulton street, unquestionably sell
<lb/>the best teas imported into this market. That they sell them cheaper than any
<lb/>other establishment, is a fact proven in a thousand instances since they have
<lb/>opened their store.
<lb/>We would advise our friends to call at this place, and if they don’t wish to
<lb/>buy at least to obtain a little pamphlet, kept on their counter, entitled “ Hints
<lb/>to Tea Drinkers,” and therefrom learn a little useful information on the subject.
<lb/>The pamphlet is given gratis.—Anglo American.
<lb/>The finest specimens of green and black teas ever sold in this country, are
<lb/>imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street. Those who want good
<lb/>teas at reasonable prices, can always get them there.—Tribune.
<lb/>We have tried the teas imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street,
