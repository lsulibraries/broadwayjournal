            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">One of those innocent persons who conceive themselves to 
               <lb></lb>have been sent into the
               world, like Mr. Moddle, on a mis- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>sion, has recently taken it into his
               head to abuse our Journal 
               <lb></lb>roundly in an eastern paper, on the assumed ground that we
               
               <lb></lb>are opposed to reform. This assumption is mainly based upon 
               <lb></lb>our remarks upon
               Miss Fuller’s “Woman in the Nineteenth 
               <lb></lb>Ceutury.” Our eyes are not shut to the evils
               of society, nor 
               <lb></lb>are we by any means indifferent about their existence, for we
               
               <lb></lb>happen to experience personal discomforts every day, which 
               <lb></lb>are owing to some
               abuse of law or custom that might better 
               <lb></lb>be abolished than not; but we have learned
               to take our daily 
               <lb></lb>rubs coolly, and we can look upon the sufferings of others
               
               <lb></lb>with quite as much composure as we can endure our own. 
               <lb></lb>We have but little faith
               in the plan which our modern reform- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ers adopt, of scolding the world into
               good behavior; and we 
               <lb></lb>have less faith still in the efficacy of societies to reform
               abuses, 
               <lb></lb>particularly the abuses of foreign governments. Our reform- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ers are too apt to forget that "the earth is the Lord’s," and 
               <lb></lb>trust to Him too
               little to provide for the happiness of his 
               <lb></lb>children, trusting loo much to themselves.
               Every man has 
               <lb></lb>it in his own power to reform himself, and when he has done 
               <lb></lb>that
               well, he is in a capital condition to help reform the 
               <lb></lb>world, but not before. There
               are some excellent hints on this 
               <lb></lb>subject in the Bible, which would do our eastern
               friend peculiar
               <cb n="2"></cb>
               
               <lb></lb>good, if he were to meditate on them whenever he may feel 
               <lb></lb>disposed to hurl his
               arrows at supposed non-reformers, like 
               <lb></lb>ourselves. We do not believe in the existence
               of individual or 
               <lb></lb>isolated vices in a society; it is, therefore, an idle task to at-
               
               <lb break="no"></lb>tempt to heal it of any one disorder. The whole system must 
               <lb></lb>be
               purged of its evil humors. If we concentrate ail our ener- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>gies in the
               endeavor to remove a particular evil, all the others 
               <lb></lb>will grow the more vigorously
               for being neglected; while we 
               <lb></lb>are trying to cure the world of gambling,
               licentiousness and 
               <lb></lb>avarice and lying and oppression and thievery and drunken- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ness will grow in strength. The whole body must be phy- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>sicked, and not one of its members, to restore it to health.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It is unfortunate for those unhappy persons who arrogate 
               <lb></lb>to themselves the divine
               title of reformers, that they gener- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ally forget to reform themselves, and
               they consequently make 
               <lb></lb>as ridiculous a figure in the world as the fat man in the mob
               
               <lb></lb>that Dean Swift tells of, who kept complaining of the crowd 
               <lb></lb>until a by-stander
               reminded him that it was his own carcass 
               <lb></lb>that caused all the inconvenience, and that
               there would be 
               <lb></lb>room enough if he were only out of the way.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The true reformers of the world are those who scatter 
               <lb></lb>truths ; it matters not a
               straw what they are. Every dis- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>covery in what are called the physical
               sciences, obliterates 
               <lb></lb>some moral evil. The man with the most knowledge is the
               
               <lb></lb>greatest reformer, but the converse of this proposition is sup- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>posed
               to be the case, and the country is overrun with witlings 
               <lb></lb>who set about reforming
               society before they have mastered 
               <lb></lb>their alphabets. In all countries, but in ours
               above all, the 
               <lb></lb>intelligence of the people is the law; therefore it is better to
               
               <lb></lb>aim at enlightening the people, than to get up a crusade 
               <lb></lb>against the law itself.
               The statute books of England and the 
               <lb></lb>United States are full of dead laws, strangled
               by the intelli- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>gence of the people, but not repealed. The law of capital
               
               <lb></lb>punishment is dying daily ; the progress of a certain trial the 
               <lb></lb>past week,
               proves that it is almost dead. It is well for a bad 
               <lb></lb>law to be repealed the moment
               that its wickedness is felt, 
               <lb></lb>but the philanthropist need give himself no uneasiness
               about 
               <lb></lb>it; let him instruct the people, and the law will die of itself. 
               <lb></lb>Ignorance
               is the great father of law, and when the law is in 
               <lb></lb>advance of the people, they will
               make laws for themselves, 
               <lb></lb>like the Lynch-laws of the west. If we take a glance at the
               
               <lb></lb>history of the world, we shall find that all the reformers have 
               <lb></lb>been poets or
               the discoverers of truths in science, while pra- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ters about reform have
               left the world quite as full of error as 
               <lb></lb>they found it. Milton’s Comus has doubtless
               done much 
               <lb></lb>towards reforming the world, but his Tetrachordon, and other 
               <lb></lb>tracts,
               which were intended expressly to reform it, have done 
               <lb></lb>nothing.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Our abusive friend is doubtless very sincere in his belief 
               <lb></lb>that the world is to be
               reformed by newspaper paragraphs, 
               <lb></lb>and we wish him nothing worse than that he may live
               to 
               <lb></lb>see his faith verified.

            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">That Pierre Bon-Bon was a restaurateur of uncommon qualifications, no man who, during

               himself at liberty to dispute. That 
               <lb></lb>Pierre Bon-Bon was, in an equal degree, skilled
               in the phil
               <pb n="244"></pb>
               
               <cb n="1"></cb>osophy of that period is, I presume, still more especially un- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>deniable. His patés à la fois were beyond doubt immacu- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>late : but what
               pen can do justice to his essays sur la Nature 
               <lb></lb>—his thoughts sur I'Ame—his
               observations sur VEsprit ? If 
               <lb></lb>his omelettes—if his fricandeaux were inestimable, what
               lit- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>térateur of that day would not have given twice as much (or 
               <lb></lb>an “
               Idée de Bon-Bon" as for all the trash of all the “ Idées" 
               <lb></lb>of all the rest of the
               savants ? Bon-Bon had ransacked libra- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ries which no other man had
               ransacked—had read more than 
               <lb></lb>any other would have entertained a notion of reading—had
               
               <lb></lb>understood more than any other would have conceived the 
               <lb></lb>possibility of
               understanding; and although, while he flour- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ished, there were not wanting
               some authors at Rouen to as- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>sert “ that his dicta evinced neither the
               purity of the Acade- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>my, nor the depth of the Lyceum”—although, mark me,
               his 
               <lb></lb>doctrines were by no means very generally comprehended, 
               <lb></lb>still it did not
               follow that they were difficult of comprehen- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>sion. It was, I think, on
               account of their self-evidency that 
               <lb></lb>manv persons were led to consider them abstruse.
               It is to 
               <lb></lb>Bon-Bon—but let this go no farther —it is to Bon-Bon that 
               <lb></lb>Kant himself
               is mainly indebted for his metaphysics. The 
               <lb></lb>former was indeed not a Platonist, nor
               strictly speaking an 
               <lb></lb>Aristotelian—nor did he, like the modern Leibnitz, waste
               
               <lb></lb>those precious hours which might be employed in the inven- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tion of a
               fricasée, or, facili gradú, the analysis of a sensation, 
               <lb></lb>in frivolous attempts at
               reconciling the obstinate oils and wa- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ters of ethical discussion. Not at
               all. Bon-Bon was Ionic 
               <lb></lb>—Bon-Bon was equally Italic. He reasoned à priori—He
               
               <lb></lb>reasoned also à posteriori. His ideas were innate—or 
               <lb></lb>otherwise. He believed in
               George of Trebizond—He be- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>lieved in Bossarion. Bon-Bon was emphatically
               a—Bon- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>Bonist.

            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of restau- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>rateur. I
               would not, however, have any friend of mine im- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>agine that, in fulfilling
               his hereditary duties in that line, our 
               <lb></lb>hero wanted a proper estimation of their
               dignity and impor- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tance. Far from it. It was impossible to say in which
               
               <lb></lb>branch of his profession he took the greater pride. In his 
               <lb></lb>opinion the powers of
               the intellect held intimate connec- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tion with the capabilities of the
               stomach. I am not sure, 
               <lb></lb>indeed, that he greatly disagreed with the Chinese, who
               
               <lb></lb>hold that the soul lies in the abdomen. The Greeks at all events 
               <lb></lb>were right, he
               thought, who employed the same word for 
               <lb></lb>the mind and the diaphragm.

               <lb></lb>charge to the prejudice of the
               metaphysician. If Pierre Bon-

               <lb></lb>failings of very little importance—faults indeed which, in 
               <lb></lb>other tempers, have
               often been looked upon rather in the 
               <lb></lb>light of virtues. As regards one of these
               foibles, I should not 
               <lb></lb>even have mentioned it in this history but for the remarka- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ble prominency—the extreme alto relievo—in which it jut- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ted
               out from the plane of his general disposition.—He could 
               <lb></lb>never let slip an opportunity
               of making a bargain.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Not that he was avaricious—no. It was by no means 
               <lb></lb>necessary to the satisfaction of
               the philosopher, that the bar- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>gain should be to his own proper advantage.
               Provided a 
               <lb></lb>trade could be effected—a trade of any kind, upon any terms, 
               <lb></lb>or under
               any circumstances—a triumphant smile was seen 
               <lb></lb>for many days thereafter to enlighten
               his countenance, and a 
               <lb></lb>knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">At any epoch it would not be very wonderful it a humor 
               <lb></lb>so peculiar as the one I have
               just mentioned, should elicit 
               <lb></lb>attention and remark. At the epoch of our narrative,
               had 
               <lb></lb>this peculiarity not attracted observation, there would have 
               <lb></lb>been room for
               wonder indeed. It was soon reported that, 
               <lb></lb>upon all occasions of the kind, the smile
               of Bon-Bon was 
               <lb></lb>wont to differ widely from the downright grin with which 
               <lb></lb>he would
               laugh at his own jokes, or welcome an acquain- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tance. Hints were thrown
               out of an exciting nature ; stories 
               <lb></lb>were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry
               and repented 
               <lb></lb>of at leisure; and instances were adduced of unaccountable
               
               <lb></lb>capacities, vague longings, and unnatural inclinations im- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>planted by
               the author of all evil for wise purposes of his 
               <lb></lb>own.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The philosopher had other weakneses—but they are scarce- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ly worthy our
               serious examination. For example, there are 
               <lb></lb>few men of extraordinary profundity who
               are found wanting 
               <lb></lb>in an inclination for the bottle. Whether this inclination be
               <cb n="2"></cb>
               
               <lb></lb>an exciting cause, or rather a valid proof, of such profundi- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ty, it
               is a nice thing to say. Bon-Bon, as far as I can learn, 
               <lb></lb>did not think the subject
               adapted to minute investigation;— 
               <lb></lb>nor do I. Yet in the indulgence of a propensity so
               truly clas- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>sical, it is not to be supposed that the restaurateur would
               
               <lb></lb>lose sight of that intuitive discrimination which was wont to 
               <lb></lb>characterise, at
               one and the same time, his essais and his 
               <lb></lb>omelettes. In his seclusions the Vin de
               Bourgogne had its al- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>lotted hour, and there were appropriate moments for
               the 
               <lb></lb>Côtes du Rhone. With him Sauterne was to Medoc what 
               <lb></lb>Catullus was to Homer.
               He would sport with a syllogism 
               <lb></lb>in sipping St. Peray, but unravel an argument over
               Clos de 
               <lb></lb>Vougeot, and upset a theory in a torrent of Chamberlin. 
               <lb></lb>Well had it been
               if the same quick sense of propriety had 
               <lb></lb>attended him in the peddling propensity to
               which I have 
               <lb></lb>formerly alluded—but this was by no means the case. In- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>deed, to say the truth, that trait of mind in the philosophic 
               <lb></lb>Bon-Bon did begin at
               length to assume a character of strange 
               <lb></lb>intensity and mysticism, and appeared deeply
               tinctured wilh

            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">To enter the little Cafe in the Cul-de-Sac Le Febvre was, 
               <lb></lb>at the period of our tale,
               to enter the sanctum of a man of 
               <lb></lb>genius. Bon-Bon was a man of genius. There was not a
               
               <lb></lb>sous-cuisinier in Rouen, who could not have told you that 
               <lb></lb>Bon-Bon was a man of
               genius. His very cat knew it, and 
               <lb></lb>forebore to whisk her tail in the presence of the
               man of ge- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>nius. His large water-dog was acquainted with the fact,
               
               <lb></lb>and upon the approach of his master, betrayed his sense of 
               <lb></lb>inferiority by a
               sanctity of deportment, a debasement of the 
               <lb></lb>ears, and a dropping of the lower jaw not
               altogether unwor- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>thy of a dog. It is, however, true that much of this
               habitual 
               <lb></lb>respect might have been attributed to the personal appear- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ance of the metaphysician. A distinguished exterior will, I 
               <lb></lb>am constrained to say,
               have its weight even with a beast; 
               <lb></lb>and I am willing to allow much in the outward man
               of the 
               <lb></lb>restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of the 
               <lb></lb>quadruped.
               There is a peculiar majesty about the atmos- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>phere of the little great—if
               I may be permitted so equivocal 
               <lb></lb>an expression—which mere physical bulk alone will be
               found 
               <lb></lb>at all times inefficient in creating. If, however, Bon-Bon 
               <lb></lb>was barely
               three feet in height, and if his head was diminu- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tively small, still it
               was impossible to behold the rotundity 
               <lb></lb>of his stomach without a sense of magnificence
               nearly border- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ing upon the sublime. In its size both dogs and men must
               
               <lb></lb>have seen a type of his acquirements—in its immensity a fit- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ting
               habitation for his immortal soul.

               mere circumstances of the external 
               <lb></lb>metaphysician. I might hint that the hair of our
               hero was 
               <lb></lb>worn short, combed smoothly over his forehead, and sur- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>mounted by a conical-shaped white flannel cap and tassels—

               barbarous period, with cloth of the same quality and 
               <lb></lb>color as the garment, but faced
               in a more fanciful manner 
               <lb></lb>with the particolored velvet of Genoa—that his slippers
               were 
               <lb></lb>of a bright purple, curiously filagreed, and might have been 
               <lb></lb>manufactured
               in Japan, but for the exquisite pointing of the

               <lb></lb>dressing-wrapper, and richly bestudded all over with crimson 
               <lb></lb>devices, floated
               cavalierly upon his shoulders like a mist of 
               <lb></lb>the morning—and that his tout ensemble
               gave rise to the re-

               indeed a bird of Paradise, or the rather a very Paradise 
               <lb></lb>of perfection."—I might, I
               say, expatiate upon all these

               estimate 
               <lb></lb>the merits of the sanctum. A sign consisting of a vast folio 
               <lb></lb>swung
               before the entrance. On one side of the volume was 
               <lb></lb>painted a bottle; on the reverse a
               pate. On the back were 
               <lb></lb>visible in large letters the words Œuvres de Bon-Bon. T bus
               
               <lb></lb>was delicately shadowed forth the two-fold occupation of

               to view. A long, low pitched room 
               <lb></lb>of antique construction, was indeed all the
               accommodation af- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>forded by the Càfe. In a corner of the apartment stood
               the 
               <lb></lb>bed of the metaphysician. An array of curtains, together with 
               <lb></lb>a canopy à la
               Greque, gave it an air at once classic and com- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>fortable. In the corner
               diagonally opposite, appeared, in di-

               properties of the kitchen and the 
               <lb></lb>bibliotheque. A dish of polemics stood peacefully
               upon the 
               <lb></lb>dresser. Here lay an oven-full of the latest ethics—there a 
               <lb></lb>kettle of
               duodecimo melanges. Volumes of German morali-

               wind that, 
               <lb></lb>rushing through the crannies in the wall, and pouring impet-

               <lb></lb>attempting des œufs à la Princesse he had unfortunately 
               <lb></lb>perpetrated an omelete à

               the overturning of a

               <lb></lb>those admirable bargains which he at all times took such 
               <lb></lb>especial delight in
               bringing to a successful termination. But

               large black water-dog we have spoken of 
               <lb></lb>before, and settling himself uneasily in his
               chair, he could 
               <lb></lb>not help casting a wary and unquiet eye towards those dis- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows

               completed a scrutiny whose

               <lb break="no"></lb>pers,
               and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a 
               <lb></lb>Voluminous manuscript, intended
               for publication on the mor- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>row.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">He had been thus occupied for some minutes when “ I am 
               <lb></lb>in no hurry, Monsieur
               Bon-Bon,” suddenly whispered a whin- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ing voice in the apartment.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“The devil!” ejaculated 
               <cb n="2"></cb>our hero, starting to his feet, 
               <lb></lb>overturning the
               table at his side, and staring around him in 
               <lb></lb>astonishment.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“ Very true,” calmly replied the voice.</p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“ Very true!—what is very true?—how came you here ?" 
               <lb></lb>vociferated the metaphysician,
               as his eye fell upon something 
               <lb></lb>which lay stretched at full length upon the bed.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">"I was saying,” said the intruder, without attending to 
               <lb></lb>the interrogatories, “ I was
               saying that I am not at all push- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ed for lime—that the business upon which
               I took the liber- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ty of calling is of no pressing importance—in short that
               I 
               <lb></lb>can very well wait until you have finished your Exposition.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“ My Exposition !—there now !—how do you know-how 
               <lb></lb>came you to understand that I was
               writing an exposition ? 
               <lb></lb>good God!"
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“ Hush !" replied the figure in a shrill under tone: and, 
               <lb></lb>arising quickly from the
               bed, he made a single step towards
               <cb n="2"></cb>
               
               <lb></lb>our hero, while an iron lamp that depended overhead swung 
               <lb></lb>convulsively back from
               his approach. 
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The philosopher’s amazement did not prevent a narrow 
               <lb></lb>scrutiny of the stranger’s
               dress and appearance. The out- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>lines of a figure, exceedingly lean, but
               much above the com- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>mon height, were rendered minutely distinct by means
               of a 
               <lb></lb>faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin, but 
               <lb></lb>was otherwise
               cut very much in the style of a century ago. 
               <lb></lb>These garments had evidently been
               intended for a much 
               <lb></lb>shorter person than their present owner. His ankles and
               
               <lb></lb>wrists were left naked for several inches. In his shoes, 
               <lb></lb>however, a pair of very
               brilliant buckles gave the lie to the 
               <lb></lb>extreme poverty implied by the other portions
               of his dress. 
               <lb></lb>His bead was bare, and entirely bald, with the exception of 
               <lb></lb>the
               hinder part, from which depended a queue of considerable 
               <lb></lb>length. A pair of green
               spectacles, with side glasses, pro- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tected his eyes from the influence of
               the light, and at the 
               <lb></lb>same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their
               
               <lb></lb>color or their conformation. About the entire person there 
               <lb></lb>was no evidence of a
               shirt; but a white cravat, of filthy ap- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>pearance, was tied with extreme
               precision around the throat, 
               <lb></lb>and the ends, hanging down formally side by side, gave
               (al- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>though I dare say unintentionally) the idea of an ecclesiastic.
               
               <lb></lb>Indeed, many other points both in his appearance and de- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>meanour
               might have very well sustained a conception of that 
               <lb></lb>nature. Over his left ear, he
               carried, after the fashion of a 
               <lb></lb>modern clerk, an instrument resembling the stylus of
               the an- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>cients. In a breast-pocket of his coat appeared conspicuously
               
               <lb></lb>a small black volume fastened with clasps of steel. This 
               <lb></lb>book, whether
               accidentally or not, was so turned outwardly 
               <lb></lb>from the person as to discover the words
               “ Rituel Catholique” 
               <lb></lb>in white letters upon the back. His entire physiognomy was
               
               <lb></lb>interestingly saturnine—even cadaverously pale. The fore- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>head was
               lofty, and deeply furrowed with the ridges of con- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>templation. The corners
               of the mouth were drawn down 
               <lb></lb>into an expression of the most submissive humility.
               There 
               <lb></lb>was also a clasping of the hands, as he stepped towards our 
               <lb></lb>hero—a deep
               sigh—and altogether a look of such utter sanc- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tity as could not have
               failed to be unequivocally preposses- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>sing. Every shadow of anger faded
               from the countenance of 
               <lb></lb>the metaphysician, as, having completed a satisfactory sur-
               
               <lb break="no"></lb>vey of his visiter’s person, he shook him cordially by the 
               <lb></lb>hand,
               and conducted him to a seat.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">There would however be a radical error in attributing this 
               <lb></lb>instantaneous transition
               of feeling in the philosopher, to any 
               <lb></lb>one of those causes which might naturally be
               supposed to 
               <lb></lb>have had an influence. Indeed Pierre Bon-Bon, from what I 
               <lb></lb>have been
               able to understand of his disposition, was of all 
               <lb></lb>men the least likely to be imposed
               upon by any speciousness 
               <lb></lb>of exterior deportment. It was impossible that so accurate
               
               <lb></lb>an observer of men and things should have failed to discover, 
               <lb></lb>upon the moment,
               the real character of the personage who 
               <lb></lb>had thus intruded upon his hospitality. To
               say no more, the 
               <lb></lb>conformation of his visiter’s feet was sufficiently remarkable
               
               <lb></lb>—he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">hat—there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part</p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">of his breeches—and the vibration of his coat tail was a pal- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>pable fact.
               Judge then with what feelings of satisfaction our 
               <lb></lb>hero found himself thrown thus at
               once into the society of a 
               <lb></lb>person for whom he had at all times entertained the most
               
               <lb></lb>unqualified respect. He was, however, too much of the di- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>plomatist
               to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions 
               <lb></lb>in regard to the true state of
               affairs. It was not his cue to 
               <lb></lb>appear at all conscious of the high honor he thus
               unexpect- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>edly enjoyed, but by leading his guest into conversation, to
               
               <lb></lb>elicit some important ethical ideas, which might, in obtaining 
               <lb></lb>a place in his
               contemplated publication, enlighten the human 
               <lb></lb>race and at the same time immortalize
               himself—ideas which, 
               <lb></lb>I should have added, his visiter’s great age, and well known
               
               <lb></lb>proficiency in the science of morals, might very well have 
               <lb></lb>enabled him to
               afford.

            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Actuated by these enlightened views, our hero bade the 
               <lb></lb>gentleman sit down, while he
               himself took occasion to throw 
               <lb></lb>some faggots upon the fire, and place upon the now
               re-estab- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>lished table some bottles of Mousseux. Having quickly com- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>pleted these operations, he drew his chair vis-à-vis to his 
               <lb></lb>companion’s
               and waited until the latter should open the con- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>versation. But plans even
               the most skillfully matured are 
               <lb></lb>often thwarted in the outset of they application, and
               the 
               <lb></lb>restaurateur found himself nonplussed by the very first words 
               <lb></lb>of his
               visiter's speech.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">"I see you know me, Bon-Bon,” said he: “ha! ha!ha!—

               <cb n="1"></cb>he! he! he !—hi! hi! hi!—ho! ho ! ho!—hu! hu! hu!”—and 
               <lb></lb>the devil, dropping
               at once the sanctity of his demeanour, 
               <lb></lb>opened to its fullest extent a mouth from ear
               to ear, so as to 
               <lb></lb>display a set of jagged and fang-like teeth, and throwing back
               
               <lb></lb>his head, laughed long, loudly, wickedly, and uproariously, 
               <lb></lb>while the black dog,
               crouching down upon his haunches, 
               <lb></lb>joined lustily in the chorus, and the tabby cat,
               flying off at a 
               <lb></lb>tangent, stood up on end and shrieked in the farthest corner 
               <lb></lb>of
               the apartment.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Not so the philosopher ; he was too much a man of the 
               <lb></lb>world either to laugh like the
               dog, or by shrieks to betray 
               <lb></lb>the indecorous trepidation of the cat. It must be
               confessed, 
               <lb></lb>he felt a little astonishment to see the white letters which 
               <lb></lb>formed
               the words “ Rituel Catholique" on the book in his 
               <lb></lb>guest’s pocket, momently changing
               both their color and their 
               <lb></lb>import, and in a few seconds, in place of the original
               title, 
               <lb></lb>the words Régitre des Condamnés blaze forth in characters 
               <lb></lb>of red. This
               startling circumstance, when Bon-Bon replied 
               <lb></lb>to his visiter’s remark, imparted to his
               manner an air of em- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>barrassment which probably might not otherwise have
               been 
               <lb></lb>observed.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“Why, sir.” said the philosopher, “why, sir, to speak 
               <lb></lb>sincerely—I believe you

            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“ Oh !—ah!—yes!—very well !” interrupted his Majesty, 
               <lb></lb>"say no more—I see how it is.”
               And hereupon, taking off 
               <lb></lb>his green spectacles, he wiped the glasses carefully with
               the 
               <lb></lb>sleeve of his coat, and deposited them in his pocket.
            </p>

               <lb></lb>his amazement was now
               much increased by the spectacle 
               <lb></lb>which here presented itself to view. In raising his
               eves, 
               <lb></lb>with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain the color of his 
               <lb></lb>guest’s,
               he found them by no means black, as he bad antici- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>pated—nor gray, as
               might have been imagined—nor yet ha-

               red—nor purple—nor

               <lb></lb>or
               in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. In 
               <lb></lb>short Pierre Bon-Bon not
               only saw plainly that his Majesty 
               <lb></lb>had no eyes whatsoever, but could discover no
               indications of 
               <lb></lb>their having existed at any previous period ; for the space 
               <lb></lb>where
               eyes should naturally have been, was, I am constrained 
               <lb></lb>to say, simply a dead level of
               flesh.

               <lb break="no"></lb>menon, and the reply of his Majesty was
               at once prompt, dig-

               the affection

               <lb></lb>thousand
               pardons. He met me at Athens, one day, in the 
               <lb></lb>Parthenon, and told me he was
               distressed for an idea. I bade 
               <lb></lb>him write down that ο νους εςτιν αυλος. He said that
               he 
               <lb></lb>would do so, and went home, while I stepped over to the 
               <lb></lb>pyramids. But my
               conscience smote me for having uttered a 
               <lb></lb>truth, even to aid a friend, and hastening
               back to Athens, I 
               <lb></lb>arrived behind the philosopher’s chair as he was inditing the
               
               <lb></lb>‘αυλος.’ Giving the lamma a fillip with my finger I turned it 
               <lb></lb>upside down. So
               the sentence now reads ‘ ο νους εςτιν αυγος,'

            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Paul Delaroche was born in Paris, in 1797. His father 
               <lb></lb>was a man of taste, and was
               appointed to value the works 
               <lb></lb>of Art which were offered at the Mont-de-Piété. He
               encour- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>aged in his two sons an inclination for the purest Art; and
               
               <lb></lb>the elder, M. Jules Delaroche, after having made con- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>siderable
               progress as a painter of history, renounced the pro- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>fession, and
               succeeded to the appointment which his father 
               <lb></lb>held, and has risen to the directorship
               of the Mont-de-Piété. 
               <lb></lb>The younger persevered in his studies, and has, by his
               assid-
               <pb n="249" break="no"></pb>
               
               <cb n="1"></cb>uity, attained to the first rank among the painters of the 
               <lb></lb>French
               school.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Paul Delaroche devoted himself first to landscape painting; 
               <lb></lb>he then entered the
               atelier of Gros, under whom he applied 
               <lb></lb>himself to the human figure, and soon became
               distinguished 
               <lb></lb>by the rapid progress he made. Under Gros the young De- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>laroche also soon declared his dissent from what is termed 
               <lb></lb>the hitherto prevalent “
               classicism” of the French school, 
               <lb></lb>which was then yielding to the Renaissance; but
               took up a 
               <lb></lb>position between the classic and the romantic, and labored 
               <lb></lb>to create a
               style in harmony with the temper and habits of 
               <lb></lb>his time. He commenced,
               notwithstanding, in that mystico- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>biblical style which flourished a few
               years under the restora- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tion, and which has even of late shown symptoms
               of revi- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>val ; but he soon discovered that this style did not suit him.
               
               <lb></lb>His first picture, 'Naphthali in the Desert,’ which he pain- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ted at
               the age of twenty-two, was exhibited in the year 
               <lb></lb>1819, but it attracted no attention;
               another, the subject of 
               <lb></lb>which was ‘ Joas Rescued by Josabeth,’ was more fortunate.
               
               <lb></lb>This was exhibited in 1822,' and sufficiently indicated those 
               <lb></lb>powers which M.
               Delaroche subsequently developed and so 
               <lb></lb>judiciously tempered. In a compte-rendu of
               the Salon of 
               <lb></lb>1822, by M. Thiers, this picture is spoken of in terms highly
               
               <lb></lb>complimentary to the young artist. In 1824 he produced 
               <lb></lb>three pictures, which won
               for him a gold medal. The first 
               <lb></lb>represented 'Vincent de Paul Preaching in the
               Presence of 
               <lb></lb>the Court of Louis XII.;’ the second, ‘ Joan of Arc Examin- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ed in Prison by the Cardinal of Winchester;' the third,' Saint
               Sebastian.’
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In 1827 ‘ The Capture of the Trocadero’ appeared, a work 
               <lb></lb>which had been commissioned
               by the Government, and for 
               <lb></lb>which he received the cross of the Legion of Honor. About
               
               <lb></lb>the same period he exhibited other works, which have con- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tributed
               much to his fame. The most celebrated of these 
               <lb></lb>are, ‘ The Death of Agostino
               Carracci;' 'Flora Macdonald 
               <lb></lb>Succouring the Pretender after the Battle of Culloden ;’
               ‘ The 
               <lb></lb>Death of Queen Elizabeth,’ which hangs on the walls of the 
               <lb></lb>Luxembourg; ‘An
               Episode of the St. Bartholomew;’ ‘The 
               <lb></lb>Death of the President Duranti;’ a full-length
               portrait of the 
               <lb></lb>Dauphin, as a model, to be worked in Gobelin tapestry; 
               <lb></lb>and the
               ceiling of the Museum of Charles X.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">During some years after this period M. Delaroche painted 
               <lb></lb>only what the French call
               moyen-age subjects, although 
               <lb></lb>the term is scarcely suitable, as comprehending even
               those 
               <lb></lb>that come within a century or two of our own time. In 
               <lb></lb>1831 he produced ‘
               The Children of Edward,’ which has 
               <lb></lb>been so often engraved and lithographed, and which
               induced 
               <lb></lb>M. Delavigne to compose his tragedy on the same subject. 
               <lb></lb>Another highly
               successful picture was ‘Richelieu, on the 
               <lb></lb>Rhone, with Cinq-Mars and de Thou;' as also
               that repre- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>senting Cardinal Mazarin presiding, while even dying, at
               
               <lb></lb>a game of lansquenet. In 1832 M. Delaroche was called to 
               <lb></lb>the Institute; and in
               the same year he exhibited, perhaps, 
               <lb></lb>the most impressive of all his works, ‘ Cromwell
               Contem- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>plating the remains of Charles I.,’ a composition which, 
               <lb></lb>once
               seen, either in the original or in engraving, can never 
               <lb></lb>be forgotten. The extensive
               popularity of this production 
               <lb></lb>testifies its perfect success, and affords another
               extraordinary 
               <lb></lb>example of the valuable simplicity with which this artist 
               <lb></lb>can
               invest subjects, which in other hands would have been 
               <lb></lb>at least repulsive and,
               perhaps, atrocious. In 1834 appeared 
               <lb></lb>‘ The Execution of Lady Jane Gray ;’ which
               during the en- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tire period of its exhibition was, early and late,
               surrounded 
               <lb></lb>by a crowd of admiring spectators. On the same occasion 
               <lb></lb>were
               exhibited two other works, ‘ Galileo Studying in his 
               <lb></lb>Cabinet ;’ and a Saint Amelia,
               intended as a model for the 
               <lb></lb>painting of the great window of the chapel at the Chateau
               
               <lb></lb>d’Eu.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In 1835 M. Delaroche exhibited his picture of 'The Death 
               <lb></lb>of the Duke of Guise;’ it
               is much smaller than his other cele- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>brated works, and was the only one
               exhibited in 1835. The 
               <lb></lb>murder of the Duke of Guise, it will be remembered, was
               
               <lb></lb>effected in the Castle of Blois, by order of Henry III. The 
               <lb></lb>moment chosen is
               that when the King throws aside the 
               <lb></lb>arras from before the doorway, and, in his
               impatience to 
               <lb></lb>learn the result, asks in an agitated manner “ if all is done;" 
               <lb></lb>he
               then discovers the body of the Duke, lying near the bed ; 
               <lb></lb>and the murderers are
               relating to him the manner of his 
               <lb></lb>death. This picture was purchased by the Duke of
               Orleans, 
               <lb></lb>it displays more care and finish than any which preceded it. 
               <lb></lb>The
               intention of the painter is shown in the figure of the 
               <lb></lb>King, who looks from the
               corner of his eye to ascertain if his
               <cb n="2"></cb>
               
               <lb></lb>enemy be really dead: it is also apparent in the courtesy 
               <lb></lb>with which he is
               received by the assassins, who separate 
               <lb></lb>that he may see that his commands have been
               accomplished. 
               <lb></lb>It is in the body of the Duke that the artist recovers his grave
               
               <lb></lb>dignity: he has never produced anything more forcible than 
               <lb></lb>this. In the meantime
               he exhibited his well-known pictures, 
               <lb></lb>‘ Charles I. in the Guard-Room,’ and ‘ Lord
               Strafford.’ 
               <lb></lb>From 1837 to 1841 M. Delaroche was almost entirely occu- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>pied by his great work at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, having 
               <lb></lb>exhibited only two
               pictures, the one a fine portrait of ‘Na- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>poleon in his Cabinet at the
               Tuileries.’
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In 1835 it was proposed to M. Delaroche to enrich the 
               <lb></lb>walls of the Madeline with
               suitable compositions ; but cir- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>cumstances subsequently led to his
               resignation of the task. 
               <lb></lb> In the same year he proceeded to Italy, where he formed a
               
               <lb></lb>matrimonial alliance with the only daughter of Horace Ver- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>net, who
               was then director of the French Academy at Rome. 
               <lb></lb>M. Delaroche was amply compensated
               for his disappoint- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ment, with respect to the Madeline, by having confided
               to 
               <lb></lb>him the adornment of the Amphitheatre of the Ecole des 
               <lb></lb>Beaux Arts—a task to
               which he devoted three years of as- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>siduous labor.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The distinguished artist has recently returned from a sec- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ond visit to
               Rome, where he has executed a portrait of the 
               <lb></lb>Pope ; which, in Italy, has received
               the most unqualified 
               <lb></lb>praise. M. Delaroche has painted but very few portraits in
               
               <lb></lb>addition to those already mentioned. He has produced a 
               <lb></lb>portrait of the Countess
               Rossi (late Madlle. Sontag), and 
               <lb></lb>some others, in oil, crayon, &amp;c.; all of which
               exhibit, in a 
               <lb></lb>high degree, the striking characteristics of the accomplished
               
               <lb></lb>master, who could not devote to portraiture a genius which 
               <lb></lb>has urged him onward
               to a series of triumphs in historical 
               <lb></lb>and didactic art.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Few artists of any time, even since the revival of paint- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ing, can be
               pointed out as having passed during any given 
               <lb></lb>portion of their lives a career so
               honorable and profitable as 
               <lb></lb>that hitherto enjoyed by M. Delaroche. At a very early
               age 
               <lb></lb>he was already in the arena competing for the suffrages of 
               <lb></lb>the public; and
               in the term of twenty years he produced 
               <lb></lb>thirty pictures, all of which have been
               signally distinguished 
               <lb></lb>by the plaudits of the public, and many of which will re- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>main among the remarkable examples of the French School 
               <lb></lb>of Art. All his
               works have been popularised by the most 
               <lb></lb>skilful engravers; from a very early period
               he received the 
               <lb></lb>most flattering distinctions, and has in private life enjoyed
               
               <lb></lb>all the felicities attendant on a position so honorable. At 
               <lb></lb>present, M.
               Delaroche is again busied in his studio, with a 
               <lb></lb>prospective yet more brilliant than
               the past, and which it is 
               <lb></lb>our sincere and reasonable hope he may live most fully to
               re- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>alize.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As a teacher, Delaroche has formed a long train of pupils, 
               <lb></lb>who speak of him with
               sincere respect. In stature he 
               <lb></lb>reaches the middle height, being apparently of a
               slight but 
               <lb></lb>active frame; with a head of fine character, an eye of intel- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ligence, and very searching in its gaze.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In his private character Delaroche presents much for es- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>.teem.
               Independent of the excellence of his qualities in do- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>mestic life, he
               wears no conscious air of superiority; is free, 
               <lb></lb>frank, and affable in his manners;
               liberal in exposing the 
               <lb></lb>riches of his studio; and communicative in reference to any
               
               <lb></lb>methods of his painting which the stranger may think wor- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>thy of
               enquiry. Offered by the government a large pecuni- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ary present on the
               completion of the Hemicycle, he waived 
               <lb></lb>it for himself, on condition that it should be
               offered to in- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>crease the excellence of the engraving which, under
               sanction 
               <lb></lb>of the Government, is about to be published.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">We never encountered one who so completely realized our 
               <lb></lb>notions of high genius : his
               eloquent countenance, so full of 
               <lb></lb>rapid thought and expression—his exceeding, and
               somewhat 
               <lb></lb>restless, energy of manner—conveyed to our minds the only 
               <lb></lb>just idea we
               ever received of what we understand, or desire 
               <lb></lb>to understand, by the term soul—as
               characteristic of a na-

               The feel-

               <lb break="no"></lb>ledge
               that his high position is sustained not alone by that in- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tellectual power
               which commands reverence from all, but

               commas—the

               <lb></lb>No puff no privilege,
               is the contract. That is to say, an edi- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tor, when admitted to the
               theatre, is to be understood as 
               <lb></lb>leaving his conscience in the street. He is admitted
               not to 
               <lb></lb>judge—not to criticise—but to adulate. He is to put himself 
               <lb></lb>to the
               inconvenience of quitting his business, or his amuse- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ment, for the
               purpose of observing and reporting, for the 
               <lb></lb>management, whatever is occurring at the
               theatre. On en- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tering, he is to content himself with standing where he
               can— 
               <lb></lb>his usual position being in the lobby, where he peeps, as well 
               <lb></lb>as he may,
               through the Venetian shutters of the boxes—for 
               <lb></lb>usually he cannot go until late, and
               no accommodations are 
               <lb></lb>afforded him—no seats are reserved for his use. And for the
               
               <lb></lb>honor of doing all this, he is complimented with what ?—the
               <pb n="252"></pb>
               
               <cb n="1"></cb>privilege of entering the doors of the Temple consecrated to 
               <lb></lb>the
               Quinneford—the value of the privilege in actual money, 
               <lb></lb>ranging from one dollar to
               twenty-five cents per night; ad- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>mitting that circumstances are at the
               very best, and that the 
               <lb></lb>editor is so fortunate as to secure such a seat as he could
               
               <lb></lb>procure for the twenty-five cents or the dollar, paid at the 
               <lb></lb>door. Deducting the
               difficulties and inconveniences to which 
               <lb></lb>he is necessarily subjected, the privileges
               may be estimated 
               <lb></lb>as from 6 1/4 to 12 1/2 cents per evening—a price quite sufficient,
               
               <lb></lb>we presume, in the opinion of the Quinnefords, for the con- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>glomerated consciences of all the editors within the limits of 
               <lb></lb>Christendom.

            </h2>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Indian Guide.—A capital painting, of this name, has recently 
               <lb></lb>been added to the
               collection of the Art-Union of this city. It is the work 
               <lb></lb>of Charles Deas, formerly of
               New York, but at present residing in St. 
               <lb></lb>Louis. Those who admired his “ Long Jake,”
               the Santa Fe trader, 
               <lb></lb>will understand the merit of the "Indian Guide,” when we say
               that 
               <lb></lb>it would form an admirable companion to that picture.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Indian Guide is a half-breed; a tall gaunt figure, mounted on a 
               <lb></lb>pony, moving at
               a rapid gallop across a prairie : there is no other figure 
               <lb></lb>in sight, excepting an
               emigrant standing at his wagon in the extreme 
               <lb></lb>distance. The pony must be a veritable
               portrait; he is as character- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>istic in his hide and trappings as his
               rider. He has been shorn of eve- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ry thing not essential to vitality—cars,
               mane, and tail; and his hide 
               <lb></lb>has been branded by the marking iron of successive
               owners. The 
               <lb></lb>Guide carries a long-barrelled fowling piece in his hand; and slung at
               
               <lb></lb>his back, there is some kind of game that he has just killed. The 
               <lb></lb>purple sky,
               though apparently greatly exaggerated in color, is doubtless 
               <lb></lb>true to nature, and it
               helps to give an air of mystery and wildness to 
               <lb></lb>the whole composition.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Mr. Deas is not one of the ideal school; he loves to paint Nature as 
               <lb></lb>he finds her,
               modestly doubting his ability to improve upon her mod- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>els. Excepting
               Mount, he is the most purely American in his feelings 
               <lb></lb>of any painter that we have
               produced. There is nothing foreign, no- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>thing copied from other pictures
               in any of his compositions that we 
               <lb></lb>have seen; every thing about them has an air of
               genuineness that 
               <lb></lb>impresses you with the feeling of truth. Among the wild frontier men
               
               <lb></lb>of the West, Mr. Deas will find many subjects for his pencil, which, we 
               <lb></lb>trust,
               will keep him well employed, and we hope to see many compan- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ions to “
               Long Jake” and the “ Indian Guide.” Pictures of pure sa- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>vage life, like
               those by Mr. Catlin, cannot excite our sympathies as 
               <lb></lb>strongly as do the
               representations of beings who belong to our own 
               <lb></lb>race. The Indian stands at an
               impassable remove from civilization, 
               <lb></lb>but the half-breed forms a connecting link
               between the white and red 
               <lb></lb>races; we feel a sympathy for the Indian Guide that we
               never could 
               <lb></lb>for the painted savage, for we see that he has a tincture of our own
               
               <lb></lb>blood, and his trappings show that he has taken one step towards re- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>finement and civilized life.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">There is another picture of genuine American feeling just added to 
               <lb></lb>the exhibition of
               the Art-Uuion, from an opposite extreme of the coun- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>try to that from
               which the Indian Guide has come. A landscape by 
               <lb></lb>Mr. Harry of Boston, representing an
               early snow scene at the head of 
               <lb></lb>the Penobscot river. Though the river is frozen and
               the ground and 
               <lb></lb>trees are covered with a frosty rime, there is a warm haze in the air
               
               <lb></lb>which looks like Indian summer. It is a very charming picture, infi- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>nitely better than some others which we have seen by the same artist.

               <lb></lb>suited to a light treble voice, or limited tenor voice, its compass only

            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">No. 7, is a charming study, by Thalberg, in A Minor. Unlike the </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">generality of this composer’s pieces, the one before us presents but few
               
               <lb></lb>difficulties. It is simply an accompanied air, which, by the bye 
               <lb></lb>though of a
               mournful character, is not distinguished either for its 
               <lb></lb>merit or its originality.
               This piece will be found a very capital exer- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>cise, and especially adapted
               to strengthen the fingers of the right hand. 
               <lb></lb>It is most admirably got out, with a
               very elegant title page. Indeed, 
               <lb></lb>all the music published by Messrs. Oakes and Wade,
               of Boston, is dis- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tinguished by the excellence and elegance of its
               mechanical depart- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ment, both in the interior and the exterior of the
               works published. The 
               <lb></lb>liberality and enterprise of these gentlemen fully merit the
               large pa- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>tronage bestowed upon them by the public.

               <lb></lb>occurred at the Custom-house, in
               London, which cannot fail to inter- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>est many of our readers. Some lime ago
               a work was published in 
               <lb></lb>New York, descriptive of the art of weaving, illustrated by a
               vast 
               <lb></lb>number of prints, showing that process in all its stages. It appears 
               <lb></lb>that
               the same work has been recently reprinted in London, by Wiley 
               <lb></lb>and Putnam, and that
               its publishers have imported several prints, ex- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>cuted in the United
               States, intending, as they state, to unite these for- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>eign prints with the
               British letter press. The officers of the Customs 
               <lb></lb>charged these prints with the
               separate duty of 1d. per print, of which 
               <lb></lb>the parties complained to the Treasury, who
               referred the matter to 
               <lb></lb>the Board of Trade. The latter board recommended the Treasury
               to 
               <lb></lb>admit these prints at the duty of £2 10s. per cwt.,—that being the 
               <lb></lb>amount of
               duty chargeable on books,—on the ground that, if the prints 
               <lb></lb>had accompanied the
               letter press, they being subsidiary,—that is, 
               <lb></lb>merely illustrative of the subject of
               the work,—they would have been 
               <lb></lb>admissible as a book at the said duty, viz., at £2
               10s.per cwt; con- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>sidering that the letter-press should not be put upon a
               worse footing 
               <lb></lb>for having been printed in England than if it had been printed in the
               Uni- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ted States. But their lordships required evidence of the fact
               alleged, 
               <lb></lb>namely, that the work in question has actually been printed in Eng- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>land. The recommendation has been acted upon.

               <lb></lb>England, a speaker related the
               following anecdote, in illustration of 
               <lb></lb>his remark that “ avarice never prospered any
               people.”
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">“ He remembered a baker that was very niggardly, and he was de- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>sirous of
               repairing his oven. Well, how to do this on economical prin- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>ciples was
               the desideratum. Fire bricks were costly, very costly.— 
               <lb></lb>What could he get ? Oh, he
               had it! There were some grave stones, 
               <lb></lb>which, if he could nicely get hold of, would
               suit very well. Could he 
               <lb></lb>get them snugly, the job would soon be done. No matter how,
               but he 
               <lb></lb>got hold of them, and immediately set to work at his oven. He en- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>larged it, and flagged it with the fragments of grave-stones ; but with- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>out thought, he placed the lettered side up. The 'baking day’ took 
               <lb></lb>took
               place. His neighbors bought their loaves. Mind, they were not 
               <lb></lb>in tins, but were
               oven-bottomed loaves, that is, the dough baked on 
               <lb></lb>the oven bottom without tins. They
               were duly baked. The neigh- 
               <lb break="no"></lb>bors fetched the loaves, but, astonishment!
               What magic ! On one 
               <lb></lb>loaf was ‘ departed this life,’ on another, ‘aged seventy-six
               years,’ 
               <lb></lb>&amp;c. The tale soon got out, and the baker was never troubled to bake
               
               <lb></lb>another, and soon was ruined. His covetousness punished himself, 
               <lb></lb>and so it would
               be with all those professing but not acting with that 
               <lb></lb>liberality that became
               Christians.”
